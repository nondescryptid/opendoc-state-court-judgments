Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9263/2019/01.\]

13 May 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Mr Yuvaraja s/o Devakumar, _claimed trial_ to a charge under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), for having not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking (“the Trafficking Charge”).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the Trafficking Charge.

3       Thereafter, the Accused pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of another charge under section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) for consumption of methamphetamine (“the Consumption Charge”).

4       I sentenced the Accused to a _total of 26 years and 7 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane_. The Accused being dissatisfied with his _conviction and sentence_ has filed an appeal. He did not apply for bail pending appeal and is _serving sentence_.

5       I had issued brief oral grounds to explain my decision to convict the Accused on the Trafficking Charge. These are available in the Transcripts for 9 September 2019 at pages 2 to 11. As the Accused had pleaded guilty to the Consumption Charge, in these grounds, I shall first focus on elaborating on my reasons for finding the Accused guilty on the Trafficking Charge. Thereafter, I will set out my reasons for the sentence.

## The Trafficking Charge

6       The details of the Trafficking Charge (DAC-941759-2016) which the Accused claimed trial to were as follows:

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 26 November 2015 at or about 12.30 pm, at Blk 279 Tampines Street 22, Singapore, together with one Thenmolli Devakumar (FIN no. XXX) and in furtherance of the common intention of the both of you, did have in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”), _to wit_, two blocks containing not less than 499.99 grams of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to be cannabis, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under section5(1)(_a_) of the MDA read with section 5(2) of the same Act and section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), and which is punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.[^1]

7       In addition, the Prosecution had initially proceeded on an additional charge (DAC-947780-2016) in relation to possession for the purpose of trafficking of not less than 999.99 grams of cannabis mixture for trial. However, in the course of the hearing, the Prosecution informed the Court that they declined to further prosecute the Accused on this charge and applied to stand down the charge. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the Prosecution applied for, and the Accused was granted a _discharge amounting to an acquittal_ on this charge.

## Background and Undisputed Facts

> **VI**.     **FORENSIC ANALYSES OF OTHER EXHIBITS**

> 20.    The hand phone marked as “YUV-HP1” seized from the accused was subsequently sent to the Forensic Response Team (“FORT”) for analysis. Arising from this analysis, Home Team Specialist Koh Soon Sim furnished the report FORT/MF/2016/0172 \[**Exhibit P1**\].

> \[The Court markings assigned to the exhibits mentioned in PS1 had been included in bold, square parentheses, for ease of reference.\]

9       In addition to the agreed facts in PS1, it was not disputed that the drugs which were the subject matter of the Trafficking Charge (as mentioned in \[8\] to \[10\] and \[13\] of PS1) were delivered by Praveen to the shoe rack outside the Accused’s flat (as seen in Photographs P3-5 and P3-7) on the day of the offence and that the Accused had subsequently thrown the same down the rubbish chute. Further, Praveen’s DNA was found in the interior of the GNC plastic bag recovered from the rubbish chute (Exhibit P43) and the green plastic bag recovered in the Accused’s flat (Exhibit P53).[^3] It was also not disputed that these drugs originated from a drug supplier in Malaysia and he was known as “Puteh” to the Accused (“the drug supplier”). In addition, both the Accused and Thenmolli had stored the drug supplier’s phone number in their communication devices under the contact name of “Dog Hunter” and “Jmgjmp” respectively. Both of them, before their arrest, had prior communications with the drug supplier.

10     During Praveen’s arrest, he was found in possession of a “POSB Go!” Debit Card (Exhibit P55 and Photograph P5-16) belonging to his girlfriend Ema George (“Ema”). It was not disputed that the Accused and Thenmolli did not know Ema. It was also not disputed that the Accused had transferred sums of $300 each on 12 November 2015 at 11.59pm ,and on 24 November 2015 at 11.09pm respectively from his DBS savings account, via ATM, to the POSB savings account linked to this Debit Card[^4], and that these transfers were meant for Praveen.

11     On 26 November 2015, prior to her arrest, Thenmolli had entered Singapore from Malaysia at 12.10pm and proceeded to visit an inmate in Singapore Changi Prison. She arrived at the Prison at about 1.58pm and departed at about 2.15pm.[^5] It was also common ground that the Accused had left Singapore for Thailand on 16 November 2015 and had returned to Singapore on 23 November 2015.[^6]

12     In addition to the forensic reports set out in \[20\] to \[22\] of PS1 relating to the telecommunication devices seized during the arrest, the following exhibits setting out further communication records of the relevant parties were also admitted into evidence in the course of the trial:

13     Finally, it was not disputed that the common street names of cannabis in Singapore were “weed”, “grass” and “ganja” and in 2015, the price from Malaysia for 1 kg of cannabis was about SGD1,800 to SGD1,900.[^7]

## The issues at trial

14     The relevant provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), relating to the Trafficking Charge, were as follows:

> **Trafficking in controlled drugs**

> 5\. –(1)    Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore ---

>> (a)    to traffic in a controlled drug;

>> …

> (2)    For the purposes of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.

15     Thus, the essential elements of the offence which the Prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt were that the Accused, together with Thenmolli, and in furtherance of their common intention:

> (a)     was in possession of the drugs;

> (b)     knew the nature of the drugs; and

> (c)     intended to traffic in the drugs.[^8]

16     Based on the undisputed facts, the Accused was in physical possession of the drugs prior to his arrest. Hence, the main issues in contention at trial were (i) whether the Accused knew the nature of the drugs and (ii) whether he intended to traffic in the drugs and (iii) whether he shared a common intention with Thenmolli to commit the offence.

17     The Defence’s position, in a nutshell, was that there was no common intention between the Accused and Thenmolli in relation to the drug transaction set out in the Trafficking Charge. The Defence’s contention was that Thenmolli was the mastermind drug trafficker who was instrumental in purchasing drugs from a Malaysian supplier. The Accused, on the other hand, was the concerned older brother who was reluctantly assisting her initially, just so that she could earn enough money to repay an alleged debt. However, the Accused had played no part in relation to the transaction which formed the subject matter of the Trafficking Charge. He had all along intended to disrupt the trafficking of those very drugs so that the Malaysian supplier would no longer trust Thenmolli and would stop supplying her with drugs. He had only pretended to participate so as to gather information.

## The case for the Prosecution

18     The Prosecution called a total of 22 witnesses for its case:

19     I do not propose to set out the evidence of all the Prosecution witnesses in detail in these grounds, but would highlight the salient parts of the material witnesses’ testimonies.

### The arrest of the Accused

20     The events leading up to the arrest of the Accused and the evidence of the CNB officers in the raiding party have been succinctly summarised by the Prosecution in \[6\] to \[15\] of the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions. As these facts were generally uncontroversial, I shall broadly adopt the Prosecution’s summary in setting out the facts relating to the Accused’s arrest below.

21     On 26 November 2015 at about 5.30am, Inspector David Ng (PW6, Conditioned Statement PS2) conducted a briefing for the following CNB Special Task Force officers:

22     He informed the officers that the Accused and Praveen were believed to be involved in drug activities. After the briefing, the team of officers left to conduct surveillance at various locations.

23     At 8.25am, Praveen was spotted at Block 470B Upper Serangoon Crescent carrying a red and white “GNC” plastic bag. He boarded at taxi at 8.35am. The plastic bag was identified to resemble Exhibit P43.[^9]

24     At 9am, a blue lorry bearing a Malaysian number plate was seen turning into a construction site at Tuas West Road. At about 9.30am, Praveen was spotted alighting from the taxi at Tuas West Road. He met up with a male Malay (later ascertained to be one Othman bin Ngadin) who had emerged from the construction site. The two of them then walked towards the construction site. At 9.42am, the male Malay entered the construction site while Praveen waited outside. At 9.48am, the male Malay drove the Malaysian lorry out of the construction site and Praveen boarded the lorry.

25     At about 10.20am, the lorry stopped along Woodlands Road and Praveen alighted carrying a green plastic bag (later identified by the officers to be Exhibit P53 as seen in Photograph P5-6).[^10] He then boarded a bus at a nearby bus stop. At about 10.55am, Praveen alighted from the bus along Marsiling Rise, still holding the green plastic bag. He then walked along the road and eventually boarded a taxi.

26     At 11.45am, the taxi stopped at the carpark near Blk 279 Tampines Street 22 (“the Accused’s block”) and Praveen alighted carrying the green plastic bag. He walked towards the lift lobby of Blk 279. He entered the lift and went up to level 5. Minutes later, the lift came down and Praveen emerged from the lift without the green plastic bag.

27     The CNB officers then prepared to raid the Accused’s unit at #XXX (”the Accused’s flat”). At about 12.33pm, SSSgt Au Yong Hong Mian (“SSSgt Au Yong”) was unloading house raiding tools (such as door ram, saw, hammers) from the boot of a CNB vehicle in the car park behind the Accused’s block. He looked up and spotted the Accused who was already standing at the kitchen window of his unit. They made eye contact. [^11] At that time, the CNB vehicle was parked close to rubbish chute no. 236/238 at the ground floor of the Accused’s block, with its boot facing the Accused’s flat.[^12]

28     At about 12.35pm, CNB officers forced open the metal gate of the Accused’s unit. The Accused opened the main door at about the same time and was arrested. About 5 to 10 minutes later, SI Kua Boon San (“SI Kua”) instructed SI Wong Kah Hung Alwin to search the rubbish chute. This was because prior to the raid, SSSgt Au Yong had reported that someone had looked down from the kitchen window of the Accused’s flat. As such, SI Kua had reason to believe that drugs had been disposed.[^13] This subsequently led to the seizure of the drugs as set out in \[13\] of the Statement of Agreed Facts.

29     After the case exhibits were seized, Sgt Yogaraj s/o Ragunathan Pillay (“Sgt Yogaraj”) commenced recording a contemporaneous statement from the Accused at the flat. However, the Accused did not respond to any questions asked by Sgt Yogaraj. He just looked at Sgt Yogaraj and kept quiet. This was noted by Sgt Yagaraj in the statement.[^14]

30     Some time after the Accused’s arrest, Thenmolli arrived at the Accused’s block with another Indian lady and two Indian men.[^15] They were arrested while making their way to the Accused’s flat, on suspicions of consumption of a controlled drug.[^16]

### The ancillary hearing and the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P22

31     At the start of the trial, the Prosecution sought to admit the Accused’s statement recorded on 2 December 2015 from 1.05pm to 5.45pm (Exhibit P22) by SI Yeo Wee Beng (“SI Yeo”) through the interpretation of the Tamil interpreter, Madam Malliga Anandha Krishnan (“Mdm Malliga”).

32     As the Defence objected to the admissibility of this statement, an ancillary hearing was conducted.

#### Prosecution’s case for the ancillary hearing

33     During the ancillary hearing, both SI Yeo and Mdm Malliga testified that no threat, inducement or promise was offered to the Accused before or during the recording of P22.

34     SI Yeo’s evidence was that the Accused was speaking in a mixture of English and Tamil and Mdm Malliga assisted to interpret when the Accused spoke in Tamil[^17]. Before recording Exhibit P22, SI Yeo had recorded another statement from the Accused on 1 December 2015 (Exhibit P23[^18]). When P22 was recorded, upon the Accused’s request, P23 was given to him to read. Thereafter, the Accused affirmed his earlier statement and did not wish to make any changes to it.[^19] When P22 was completed, the Accused read through the statement himself.[^20] Thereafter, the Accused signed at the bottom left of every page and wrote his NRIC number next to each of his signature.[^21] SI Yeo observed the Accused to be calm, forthcoming and cooperative during the recording of the statement.[^22] SI Yeo explained that the Accused answered the questions posed to him directly, and at times he would elaborate on his answers with more details.[^23] SI Yeo had recorded another statement from the Accused on 3 December 2015 (this was subsequently admitted by the Defence as Exhibit D5 in the main trial). The Accused was allowed to read Exhibit P22 and did not raise any objections or concerns thereafter.[^24] On 4 December 2015, the Accused was sent to the Complex Medical Centre for assessment.[^25]

35     The Defence put the following allegations to SI Yeo during the ancillary hearing:

> (a)     The Accused was falling sleep intermittently in front of SI Yeo when SI Yeo was questioning him. This was due to the Accused suffering from withdrawal symptoms.[^26]

> (b)     On 1 December 2015, before recording P23, SI Yeo was unhappy with the statement initially given by the Accused and proceeded to erase it. He then gave the Accused a good scolding whereupon the Accused gave information which was eventually recorded in P23.[^27]

> (c)     On 2 December 2015, when questioning the Accused during the course of recording P22, SI Yeo brought up the name of one “Abdul Karim” and told the Accused that Abdul Karim’s IO would like to question him. SI Yeo threatened the Accused that he had better cooperate or he would be charged with a capital charge concerning Abdul Karim’s transaction. However, SI Yeo also offered inducement to the Accused by saying that if the Accused cooperated with CNB in respect of Abdul Karim’s case, SI Yeo would “TIC” the charge, meaning that the Accused would be let off the charge he was being questioned on.[^28]

> (d)     As SI Yeo had recorded statements from Thenmolli on 1 and 2 December 2015, he had consciously or subconsciously introduced information from Thenmolli into the Accused’s statement.[^29]

36     Mdm Malliga testified that the Accused spoke in a mixture of English and Tamil during the recording of P22. Mdm Malliga assisted to interpret what the Accused said in Tamil to SI Yeo. She confirmed that SI Yeo had thereafter recorded what she interpreted to him in P22. Mdm Malliga also affirmed that SI Yeo had passed P22 to the Accused to read and the Accused had affirmed his statement to be true and correct by signing at the bottom of each page.[^30] Mdm Malliga did not recall the Accused falling asleep during the recording of P22, however, if he did, she would have alerted SI Yeo.[^31] Mdm Malliga also testified that when SI Yeo recorded a statement on 3 December 2015 from the Accused, P22 was given to the Accused to read through and he affirmed it to be his statement and did not ask to make any changes.[^32]

37     The Defence put the following allegations to Mdm Malliga during the ancillary hearing:

> (a)     When P22 was recorded, Mdm Malliga told the Accused that his sister was openly lying and had told a pack of lies to SI Yeo.[^33]

> (b)     On 2 December 2015, SI Yeo brought food for the Accused to eat.[^34]

38     Both SI Yeo and Mdm Malliga refuted the allegations put to them by the Defence. Specifically, SI Yeo testified that the Accused was the one who first mentioned one “Karim” to him during the recording of P22.[^35] In fact, at that juncture, SI Yeo himself was unaware who the Accused was referring to. Thus, it was only after P22 was recorded that SI Yeo had informed the Accused that Abdul Karim’s IO would like to question him.[^36]

#### Defence’s case for the ancillary hearing

39     The Accused’s evidence during his examination-in-chief was as follows:

> (a)     The Accused had not slept for 4 days because he had been taking drugs. However, once he was arrested, he started to “shut down” and could not focus. He was informed that he would be seeing a doctor and was told by a CNB officer not to say anything. The Accused was subsequently seen by a doctor at Cantonment Complex. However, the doctor did not speak to the Accused.[^37]

> (b)     The Accused gave a statement on 1 December 2015. After he started giving this statement, SI Yeo stopped him and told him about DNA and the death sentence. SI Yeo also told him that he did not have a “COC” and asked him if he wanted to continue in this manner. The Accused told SI Yeo they could start all over again. That was when SI Yeo started to record the statement proper in P23.[^38]

> (c)     On 2 December 2015, when P22 was recorded, the Accused did not intend to give the statement in that “format”. However, SI Yeo mentioned the name “Abdul Karim” and also said that he knew what had happened. The Accused asked SI Yeo what was the purpose of asking all these questions and told SI Yeo that SI Yeo could do whatever he wanted. This was because it did not appear to the Accused that he had any say. Thus, most of the contents of P22 were written by SI Yeo.[^39] When the Accused read the statement, he knew the contents were not true and thought to himself that was how people were sent to the gallows.[^40]

> (d)     In addition, during the recording of P22, Mdm Malliga had threatened the Accused in Tamil saying that his sister was lying. SI Yeo then said “boyfriend, 1 kilo … elder brother, 2 kilo, … and you’re saying your younger sister don’t know about this?” SI Yeo told the Accused that if the Accused did not give what SI Yeo wanted, SI Yeo would ensure that “all of \[them\] won’t see sunlight”.[^41]

> (e)     SI Yeo then asked the Accused if he were not involved in Abdul Karim’s case, would he have been arrested. SI Yeo also asked the Accused if he wanted to join Abdul Karim “to die”. SI Yeo told the Accused that if he did not talk about Abdul Karim’s case, he would not get the “COC” and would get the death sentence. As such, the Accused told SI Yeo about working in a particular shop and that there were drugs going to Abdul Karim from that shop. Thereafter, SI Yeo told the Accused that Abdul Karim’s IO would take a statement from the Accused and the Accused would not be charged. However, SI Yeo did not inform the Accused what he would not be charged for. Subsequently, Abdul Karim’s IO came to see the Accused and told the Accused to cooperate with him and he would get the charge relating to Abdul Karim’s case “TIC”.[^42]

> (f)     After P22 was recorded, SI Yeo gave it to the Accused. The Accused only read through it to a “certain extent” because he could not concentrate at that time.[^43]

> (g)     In fact, when P22 was recorded, the Accused was sleeping intermittently and was also eating the food placed on the table. As for Mdm Malliga, she would sometimes talk about Thenmolli and her own family matters. She would also be reading at other times.[^44]

> (h)     The Accused explained that he had high drug dependency and if he did not take drugs, he would not be able to perform for a week to 10 days.[^45]

> (i)     The Accused signed P22 because he thought he was going to be hanged. He did not know he could be defended.[^46] SI Yeo also told him two to three times that he did not give the pocket book statement, he did not sign the “COC” and if he wanted to get anything, he needed to “follow” SI Yeo by giving and signing the statement.[^47]

> (j)     The Accused was also feeling cold and had an anxiety attack in Cantonment Complex[^48].

40     During cross-examination by the Prosecution, the Accused further testified as follows:

> (a)     The Accused agreed that he was not afraid of SI Yeo on 27 November 2015, when SI Yeo recorded his cautioned statement (Exhibit D1). D1 was accurately recorded stating “I do not admit to the charge”. Similarly when P23 and P22 were recorded on 1 and 2 December 2015 respectively, the Accused was not afraid of SI Yeo.[^49] However, according to the Accused, he was already threatened on 1 December 2015 by SI Yeo and the threat was consistently in his mind such that he felt threatened throughout, including on 2 December 2015.[^50]

> (b)     On 1 December 2015, before recording P23, SI Yeo made reference to DNA and told the Accused that if he continued this way, he would be hanged. SI Yeo had first mentioned Abdul Karim’s name on 1 December 2015[^51]. According to the Accused, P23 was “partly” voluntarily given by the Accused, while the other parts were not true and added by SI Yeo[^52].

> (c)     Before and during the recording of P22, the Accused was uncomfortable because he was having an anxiety attack and was trying to control it. However, he did not tell SI Yeo about it.[^53]

> (d)     Besides alleging that the Accused’s sister was lying, Mdm Malliga had also told him that his sister had said that she did not know anything and it was all the Accused’s doing. The Accused felt that Mdm Malliga was trying to pressurise him.[^54] However, the Accused agreed that he did not include this allegation of Mdm Malliga acting improperly to pressurise him in his Case for Defence dated 28 August 2017.[^55]

> (e)     In the Accused’s view, SI Yeo was trying to get the Accused to cooperate with him so that SI Yeo could help the Accused obtain the “COC” (which the Accused understood to refer to a “Certificate of Cooperation”). In this way, SI Yeo was trying to save the Accused’s life and the Accused would not have to face capital punishment.[^56]

> (f)     SI Yeo was the first to mention the Accused’s sister on 2 December 2015. He told the Accused that his sister was not admitting to the charge and was lying. Mdm Malliga then added that his sister was lying and pushing the blame to him[^57]. However, the Accused did not believe what SI Yeo told him.[^58] The Accused agreed that this allegation against SI Yeo was also not included in his Case for Defence. He explained that he “kept some of the thing” so that if he had to claim trial, he would let it be known during the trial. However, as the Accused also did not inform his counsel about this allegation, it was not put to SI Yeo in Court.[^59]

> (g)     According to the Accused, many parts of P22 was untrue and he did notice this even though he read through the first three pages of the statement. Nonetheless, the Accused proceeded to sign the statement.[^60]

> (h)     The Accused clarified that it was only Abdul Karim’s IO who used the phrase “TIC” when the Accused was giving a statement to him, and this term was not used by SI Yeo.[^61]

> (i)     The Accused had been examined by a doctor before his cautioned statement, D1, was recorded on 27 November 2015. He did not tell the doctor that he was suffering from anxiety attack as he was told by the escorting officer not to tell the doctor anything.[^62] The Accused similarly did not tell the doctor who examined him after D1 about his anxiety attack because he was not suffering from one.[^63] When the Accused was at CMC, he also did not inform the psychiatrists of his anxiety attacks.[^64]

> (j)     The Accused was brought to NUH on 30 November 2015 for a check-up. However, because he was suffering from an anxiety attack and feeling very cold, he told the CNB officers he could not take it and was issued tramadol without seeing the doctor.[^65]

> (k)     The Accused was suffering from drug withdrawal since the date of his arrest for at least about 1 to 2 months. However, he did not mention this to the doctor who examined him on 27 November 2015 or when he was at NUH on 30 November 2015.[^66]

41     Finally during re-examination, the Accused testified that on 1 December 2015, Mdm Malliga bought cake, chocolate and Malay snacks for him and asked him what he would like to eat. The next day, Mdm Malliga bought mutton _briyani_ for him to eat. When he was eating, Mdm Malliga told him that his sister was openly lying. That was when the IO threatened the Accused.[^67]

#### Further cross-examination of SI Yeo

42     As counsel for the Accused had informed the Court that he had omitted to put certain questions concerning the “COC” across to SI Yeo, even though he had received previous instructions on the same, I allowed the Defence’s application to recall SI Yeo for further cross-examination on this point.

43     SI Yeo disagreed with the Defence that on 1 December 2015, he had told the Accused that he did not give the pocket book statement or sign the “COC”, and therefore the Accused had to tell the CNB about Abdul Karim’s case for SI Yeo to write on his behalf to say that he had cooperated. SI Yeo also explained that by the term “COC”, the Accused was actually referring to an “MDP” notice under section 33B of the MDA. This was a notification which was served to accused persons who were arrested for offences which attracted the death penalty. Such accused persons would state whether they wish to cooperate with CNB in the document and thereafter sign it.[^68]

#### Prosecution’s rebuttal evidence for the ancillary hearing

44     In view of the allegations raised by the Accused in his evidence, the Prosecution called two doctors who had examined the Accused after his arrest, but before P22 was recorded, as rebuttal witnesses.

45     Dr Faith Augustino Delovino (“Dr Faith”) was serving at the emergency medicine department of National University Hospital (NUH) on 30 November 2015 and had examined the Accused at around 10.43pm that day. The Accused’s main complaint was left shoulder pain. Dr Faith’s medical report was admitted as Exhibit P24 while the NP306 medical form filled up by her during the examination was admitted as Exhibit P25.[^69] Dr Faith testified that she did not observe the Accused presenting any withdrawal symptoms and, if he had, she would have made a comment regarding that in her notes.[^70] The Accused also did not tell her that he was suffering from drug withdrawal or that he was feeling sleepy all the time.[^71] In addition, Dr Faith did not document observing any symptoms relating to an anxiety attack.[^72] Dr Faith prescribed tramadol and panadol to the Accused. During cross-examination, Dr Faith explained that she did not input any comments in the “General Appearance” section of P25 relating to drug withdrawal signs because she did not feel it was relevant.[^73] Dr Faith also confirmed that the Accused was sent for an X-ray.[^74] The relevant clinical notes from the emergency department were admitted by the Defence as Exhibit D2. Dr Faith confirmed that she found the Accused to be alert as stated in D2.[^75]

46     Dr Shane Alexander Abucewicz Tan Yuan Yew (“Dr Tan”) was working as a locum for Healthway Medical Group when he first examined the Accused on 27 November 2015 at 2.23am. The NP306 medical form filled up by him for this medical examination was admitted as Exhibit P26 while the medical report (prepared by Dr Larry Kang) in relation to the same examination was admitted as Exhibit P27.[^76]

47     Dr Tan examined the Accused again on 27 November 2015 at 4.40am. The NP306 medical form filled up by him for this medical examination was admitted as Exhibit P28 while the medical report (prepared by Dr Larry Kang) in relation to the same examination was admitted as exhibit P29.

48     Dr Tan explained that he was conducting pre- and post-statement examinations of the Accused.[^77] In relation to the pre-statement examination at 2.23am, the main aim was to ensure that the Accused was both physically and mentally capable during the period of detention. According to Dr Tan, the Accused was “lucid, compliant, able to co-operate”. The Accused spoke to Dr Tan in English and complained to Dr Tan about a previous shoulder fracture more than a year ago which was not giving any problems at that time. He also complained of a right thigh ache which he attributed to an earlier scuffle. Dr Tan did examine the Accused for signs of withdrawal and was on the lookout for a myriad of symptoms. According to Dr Tan, he ticked the box “No” in the “General Appearance” section of P26 because there was no clear indication of drug withdrawal at that time.[^78]

49     As for the post-statement examination at 4.40am, Dr Tan recorded in P28 that there were no complaints from the Accused and there were no new injuries observed after statement taking.[^79]

50     During cross-examination, Dr Tan confirmed that when he examined the Accused, there were no clear clinical signs to suggest withdrawal. The Accused also did not provide Dr Tan with any symptoms or complain of anything to suggest that he was suffering from withdrawal.[^80] However, Dr Tan agreed that subtle signs of withdrawal, such as slight lethargy, could go unnoticed.[^81]

#### P22 was admitted into evidence

51     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, both parties tendered written submissions on the admissibility of P22 and replied to each other’s submissions orally in Court.[^82] Having carefully reviewed and considered the evidence presented before me as well as the submissions of both parties, I found that the statement in P22 was given voluntarily by the Accused and admitted it into evidence. The reasons for my decision were as follows.

52     Firstly, SI Yeo had given clear and consistent testimony that no threat, inducement or promise, including those alleged and put to him by the Defence, had been made to the Accused before or during the recording of P22. He was also firm that the Accused was not falling sleep intermittently while his statement was being recorded. As pointed out by the Prosecution in their submissions, SI Yeo was a candid and forthright witness who had no reason to falsely implicate the Accused.[^83] In fact, on 27 November 2015, SI Yeo had recorded the Accused’s cautioned statement in Exhibit D1. The Accused agreed that his denial of the capital drug trafficking charge therein was accurately recorded by SI Yeo as “I do not admit to the charge”. I agreed with the Prosecution that if SI Yeo had harboured sinister motives to frame the Accused, and given the Accused’s alleged vulnerable state as a result of his drug withdrawal, there was nothing to stop him from inserting an incriminating version in D1.[^84]

53     Furthermore, I found that SI Yeo’s evidence was corroborated by Mdm Malliga, who similarly had no reason to give false testimony against the Accused in Court. In addition, SI Yeo’s evidence found support in the testimonies of Dr Tan and Dr Faith. The doctors had examined the Accused on different days after his arrest, before P22 was recorded. Both doctors did not observe the Accused to be exhibiting any symptoms or signs indicating that he was suffering from drug withdrawal.

54     On the contrary, I found that the Accused’s allegations lacked credibility and his version smacked of an afterthought. Firstly, the Accused’s evidence was internally inconsistent.

> (a)     In his case put to SI Yeo as well as during his examination-in-chief, the Accused’s position was that SI Yeo mentioned Abdul Karim’s name on 2 December 2015. However during cross-examination, the Accused shifted his position and said that SI Yeo had first mentioned Abdul Karim’s name on 1 December 2015.

> (b)     During his examination-in-chief, the Accused had alleged that when P22 was recorded, it was Mdm Malliga who first mentioned that his sister had lied. However, during cross-examination, the Accused changed tack and said that it was SI Yeo who was first to mention that Thenmolli was lying.

55     Secondly, there were various material contradictions between the Defence’s case put to the prosecution witnesses, and the Accused’s testimony in Court. The Defence had also failed to put material aspects of the Accused’s version to the relevant prosecution witnesses.

> (a)     Although it was put to SI Yeo that he was unhappy with the information initially given by the Accused when recording P23 and that he gave the Accused a good scolding, the Accused’s version that SI Yeo had threatened him by mentioning DNA and the death sentence was never put to SI Yeo.

> (b)     It was put to Mdm Malliga that SI Yeo had brought food for the Accused on 2 December 2015. Not only was this not put to SI Yeo when he was on the witness stand during the ancillary hearing, the Accused subsequently gave evidence to the contrary, and said that it was Mdm Malliga who had bought food for him, on both 1 and 2 December 2015.

> (c)     The Accused had alleged that during the recording of P22, SI Yeo told him that Thenmolli was lying, and said “boyfriend, 1 kilo … elder brother, 2 kilo, … and you’re saying your younger sister don’t know about this?”. SI Yeo allegedly threatened that they would all not see sunlight. All these allegations were never put to SI Yeo.

> (d)     The Defence had put to SI Yeo that he had offered inducement to the Accused by suggesting that he would “TIC” the charge. Instead, the Accused’s evidence was that it was the investigating officer of Abdul Karim’s case, and not SI Yeo, who mentioned “TIC” to him.

56     Thirdly, the Accused had admitted that some of the allegations made by him during the ancillary hearing, were not mentioned in his Case for Defence:

> (a)     The Accused did not include his allegation of Mdm Malliga acting improperly to pressurise him.

> (b)     The Accused also did not include his allegation that on 2 December 2015, SI Yeo had told him that Thenmolli was not admitting to the charge and was lying.

57     Finally, the Accused’s version was contradicted by the independent evidence given by Dr Tan and Dr Faith.

> (a)     As mentioned earlier, both doctors testified that when they examined the Accused on 27 and 30 November 2015 respectively, the Accused did not exhibit any symptoms or signs that indicated that he was suffering from drug withdrawal. The Accused also did not complain of, or mention any such symptoms (including lethargy or sleepiness) to the doctors. Indeed, according to Dr Tan’s testimony, just because a person had consumed drugs, it did not mean that he would necessarily go into withdrawal.[^85]

> (b)     Further, Dr Faith’s evidence, the medical form in P25 and the hospital medical notes in D2 directly contradicted the Accused’s evidence that he was suffering from cold and severe anxiety attack on 30 November 2015 such that he did not even manage to see the doctor at NUH. Instead, looking at D2, it was quite apparent that Dr Faith had spent time examining the Accused for his complaint relating to left shoulder pain and found the Accused to be “alert”. In both P25 and D2, it could also be seen that the Accused was able to provide a coherent medical history to Dr Faith and even indicated his preference to be followed up in CGH. In fact, not only did the Accused manage to see the doctor, it was not disputed that he even went for an X-ray.

> (c)     As pointed out by the Prosecution in their submissions, the Accused’s allegation that the doctor did not speak to him during his pre- and post-statement medical examination (on 27 November 2015) were also rebutted by Dr Tan’s cogent and credible testimony.[^86]

58     Indeed, my decision to admit P22 into evidence after the ancillary hearing was fortified by subsequent developments in the main trial. I shall further elaborate on this later in these grounds.

### Praveen’s evidence

#### Praveen could not remember any material facts

59     It was quite apparent from the moment Praveen took the witness stand that he was a most reluctant witness. At the start of his evidence-in-chief, he made his position clear:

> “Your Honour, um, firstly, I’m already very depressed in slash---because of my sentence. This---since this is my 1st case and in---previously, before I got sentenced, the Judge give me RTC Report, but the DPP didn’t even consider about it. So like I say, I’m really very depressed and stressed and I don’t want to give any statements. I can’t remember anything, even though if they gonna show me all these things here. I’m sorry, Your Honour. That’s all.”[^87]

60     In the course of his evidence, Praveen would claim that he could not remember most of the material facts relating to the case and his arrest which led to his conviction in Court for the offence of drug trafficking. This was so even when documents were shown to him containing information that he should have personal knowledge of.[^88]

61     As such, the Prosecution applied to cross-examine Praveen on his previous inconsistent statements pursuant to section 147 of the Evidence Act with a view to substituting his testimony in Court with the contents of his statements pursuant to section 147(3) of the Act. In support of their application, the Prosecution referred to the High Court decision in _PP v Heah Lian Khin_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 745</span> at \[55\] as authority for the position that a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement under section 147 of the Evidence Act “must necessarily encompass a witness who had deliberately and falsely claimed that he was unable to recall the facts”. Having deliberated on the submissions by both the Prosecution and Defence on this point, I was in agreement with the Prosecution that Praveen, in claiming that he could not remember the facts of the case leading to his arrest, was deliberately refusing to testify in Court. As such, I allowed the Prosecution’s application to cross-examine Praveen on his previous inconsistent statements. [^89]

#### Praveen’s statements in P36, P37 and P38

62     Exhibit P36 was a statement recorded on 30 November 2015 at 10.40am. Praveen said that he had “scribbled” on the first page of the statement at the bottom left corner when the recorder asked him to sign.[^90] However, he claimed he could not remember whether P36 was recorded from him. Praveen also could not remember whether there was any threat, inducement or promise made to him during the recording of P36.[^91] He refused to read through P36 in Court and claimed that he could not remember the facts stated in the statement and could not confirm whether they were true or otherwise.[^92]

63     When Exhibit P37, a further statement recorded on 30 November 2015 at 5.50pm, and Exhibit P38, another further statement recorded on 3 December 2015 at 2.50pm, were shown to Praveen, he again claimed that he could not remember any of their contents except for his NRIC number which appeared in the statements. Neither could he remember whether there was any threat, inducement or promise made to him during the recording of the statements.[^93] Nonetheless he agreed that all the pages in P36, P37 and P38 appeared to carry the same signature next to his NRIC number and these could all be his signatures.[^94]

64     Praveen also could not remember the recording officer of the statements, Insp Muhammad Aliff bin Abdul Rahman (“Insp Aliff”)[^95] and the interpreter, Mr Raman Narayana (“Mr Raman”).[^96]

65     During cross-examination by the Defence, Praveen continued to claim that he could not remember the people and events relating to his arrest.[^97]

66     After Praveen had completed his testimony, the Prosecution called Insp Aliff and Mr Raman as witnesses to prove and admit P36, P37 and P38 into evidence. Insp Aliff testified that all 3 statements were recorded in English from Praveen, but as Praveen’s education level was only Primary 3, he had Mr Raman present during the process in case Praveen was unsure of any English terms. Insp Aliff testified that Praveen had signed the statements at the bottom left of each page and below each photograph attached, as well as written his own NRIC number next to his signatures.[^98] Both Insp Aliff and Mr Raman (who was a Court interpreter for 37 years before he retired and worked as a freelance interpreter for about 8 years) confirmed that no threat, inducement or promise was made to Praveen before or during the recording of all 3 statements.[^99] The contents of the statements were provided by Praveen and Insp Aliff did not insert anything of his own into the statements.[^100] In addition, Mr Raman testified that he had interpreted all 3 statements back to Praveen in Tamil.[^101]

67     The salient portions of Praveen’s statements are summarised below:

> (a)     Thenmolli had called Praveen and told him that her god-brother was dealing with drugs in Singapore and needed people to work for him. She asked if Praveen was interested. One or two days later, towards the end of October 2015, the Accused called Praveen and introduced himself as Thenmolli’s god-brother. He asked if Praveen understood what Thenmolli had explained to him and told Praveen that he would be paid $250 per delivery.[^102]

> (b)     Following this, the Accused asked Praveen to do “work” and Praveen collected and delivered drugs on the following occasions:

>> (i)       Five to six days before Deepavali[^103], Praveen collected drugs from Defu Lane and delivered them to Admiralty Link. He was paid $300 cash by the Accused.

>> (ii)       About three days after the first occasion, Praveen collected drugs from Tuas South Avenue 7 and delivered them, as instructed by the Accused, to a wooden shoe rack outside a unit on the 5th level of Blk 279 Tampines Street 22. The Accused transferred $300 to Praveen’s girlfriend’s account as his salary.

>> (iii)       Two to three days after Deepavali, Praveen collected the drugs and his salary from the same shoe rack on the 5th floor unit and delivered the drugs to Admiralty Link.[^104]

> (c)     On 24 November 2015, sometime at night, the Accused called Praveen on his handphone and told him there would be “work” the next morning. Praveen understood this to mean that he was supposed to collect drugs from one place and bring it to another place. Praveen was informed that he was to collect the drugs from a Malay man at Tuas South Ave 7. Praveen knew the Malay man as he had collected drugs from him at the same location before. The Accused also told Praveen he would transfer $300 to Praveen. $250 was Praveen’s salary and $50 was for transport.[^105]

> (d)     On 25 November 2015 at about 5 plus in the morning, the Accused called Praveen to wake him up. At about 6.30am, the Accused called Praveen again to ask him to proceed to collect the drugs. However, when Praveen was making his way to Tuas, the Accused called to inform him that the “work” was cancelled. At about 3pm, the Accused informed Praveen to standby for the next day.[^106]

> (e)     On 26 November 2015 at about 4.50am, the Accused called Praveen to wake him up. After Praveen finished bathing, he saw a message from the Accused telling him to “rest a bit”. At about 8am, Thenmolli called him from a Malaysian number and informed him that the Accused had fallen asleep. She then directed Praveen to collect the drugs from Tuas West Road.[^107]

> (f)     After collecting the drugs, Praveen placed them inside an NTUC plastic bag, placed the NTUC plastic bag into a GNC plastic bag, and placed the GNC plastic bag into a green coloured plastic bag. Praveen had brought the NTUC, GNC and green plastic bags from home, just as he was instructed by the Accused in his previous “work”. Praveen received a call from Thenmolli asking him to deliver drugs to the wooden shoe rack at the 5th floor unit of Blk 297 Tampines Street 22. Praveen knew exactly where the unit was as he had delivered drugs there before.[^108]

### Thenmolli’s evidence

68     A few days before Thenmolli was to testify in Court, she had written to the Court regarding her reluctance to give evidence in this case. In Court, Thenmolli explained that she felt that the Accused would hold a grudge against her for testifying against him. She was reluctant to testify against her brother and asked that she not be “forced” to do so. [^109] Thenmolli also had difficulties coming to terms with her sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and did not understand why she had to testify against the Accused when he was never asked to testify against her[^110]. However, after the Court explained her role as a witness in the trial, Thenmolli proceeded to provide her testimony.

69     Thenmolli gave evidence that she was staying in Malaysia with her mother before coming to Singapore with the intention to further her studies or work here.[^111] She had only gotten to know the Accused, who was her half-brother, when she was 14 years old[^112] and the Accused called her by her pet name “Kuttyma”[^113]. She started staying at the Accused’s flat about a month before her arrest, sometime after the Accused was released from jail on 4 September 2015. Thenmolli would come from Malaysia to stay in the Accused’s flat for a few days at a time. [^114]

70     Thenmolli got to know Praveen in 2015 at Vivocity as Praveen was a friend of her boyfriend. Subsequently, about 1 month before her arrest, Thenmolli introduced Praveen to the Accused so that Praveen could assist the Accused in trafficking cannabis. Thenmolli understood that Praveen was in need of money[^115] so she passed Praveen’s phone number to the Accused.[^116] Thenmolli testified that she did not contact Praveen after passing his number to the Accused. Specifically, she had not contacted Praveen on 23, 24 or 25 November 2015.[^117] Thenmolli also denied asking the Accused to transfer money to Praveen on 2 occasions.[^118]

71     On the day of her arrest, in the morning, Thenmolli received a phone call from the Malaysian drug supplier who was trying to contact the Accused. Thenmolli was in Malaysia at that time and was unaware of the Accused’s whereabouts. Thenmolli tried to call the Accused but he was not picking up the phone. Thenmolli then took a lorry number from the supplier and passed it to Praveen.[^119] Over several phone calls, she received further information from the supplier.[^120] She informed Praveen that the lorry was blue and provided Praveen with the location in Tuas.[^121] According to Thenmolli, Praveen already knew that he was supposed to collect drugs from the driver of the lorry and deliver them. Praveen asked Thenmolli where to deliver the drugs and mentioned that he was going to Woodlands.[^122]

72     Thenmolli testified that she had obtained the Malaysian drug supplier’s telephone number a few months before her arrest. She had never met the supplier. During cross-examination, she denied that she had obtained the supplier’s number because she had prior drug transactions with him. She explained that it was normal for her and the Accused to have each other’s friends’ phone numbers.[^123] According to Thenmolli, she remembered contacting the supplier once before 26 November 2015, when the Accused was in Thailand.[^124]

73     Thenmolli testified that she was not involved in any prior planning in relation to the drug transaction on 26 November 2015. Nonetheless, she had willingly helped the Accused by assisting in making the calls on that day.[^125] In fact, Thenmolli was answering the calls in the midst of rushing to come into Singapore to visit her boyfriend.[^126] As Thenmolli did not know where the Accused was and did not know what to do with the drugs, she told Praveen to deliver them to the Accused’s flat in Tampines.[^127] Thenmolli further explained that as the Accused was in the house and the drug order was his, she asked Praveen to deliver the drugs there.[^128] Praveen sent Thenmolli a message stating “work done” when he delivered the drugs.[^129]

74     Later on the same day, Thenmolli entered Singapore at about 12 noon to visit her boyfriend.[^130] Thenmolli was arrested together with 3 friends along the corridor of the Accused’s flat after she had visited her boyfriend at Changi Prison. She was heading to the flat to pick up some clothes and to talk to the Accused who had returned to Singapore from Thailand a few days earlier. Her friends were coming along to visit.[^131] Before going to the flat, Thenmolli had sent a message to the Accused but he did not respond. She thought he was sleeping inside the flat.[^132] During cross-examination, Thenmolli denied that she was going to the Accused’s flat to collect the drugs. According to Thenmolli, as far as she was concerned, the drugs did not belong to her and she was not going to benefit from it. [^133] Thenmolli denied that she had ordered the drugs in this case:[^134]

> Q    And this particular transaction was your order, not his.

> A    If it’s my order, I would take the responsible from the starting. I will never push it to my brother, how my brother is doing to me.

> Q    Alright. You see, he’s not pushing to you ---

> A    He is.

75     During cross-examination, Thenmolli explained that although she had lost the key to the Accused’s flat, she knew that the Accused was in the flat at the material time. As such, she thought that she could just call him or knock on the door and expected him to open the door for her. Thenmolli also mentioned that on the very first occasion she went to the Accused’s flat, nobody was home. A key was placed on the switchbox (as seen next to the door in Photograph 3-10) and she had gained entry by opening the door, retrieving the key and unlocking the gate with the key.[^135] Thenmolli added that she had spoken with the Accused on the phone on 25 November 2015 and informed him that she was coming into Singapore to visit her boyfriend the following day. As such, the Accused would have thought that she could be dropping by his flat on 26 November 2015.[^136]

76     Thenmolli first got to know that the Accused was involved in drugs after her boyfriend was arrested in September or October 2015 for trafficking in one kilogram of cannabis.[^137] Thenmolli denied being herself involved in trafficking cannabis before her boyfriend's arrest, or that she was aware he was involved in the drug business prior to his arrest.[^138] Thenmolli testified that Exhibit P42, the weighing scale shown in Photograph P5-8 belonged to the Accused[^139]. She did not know why it was found on her bed (seen on the left in Photograph P4-15), when CNB raided the apartment.[^140]

#### Thenmolli’s testimony on P6A

77     After Thenmolli had completed her evidence, additional data was extracted from her Samsung tablet (Exhibit P7) and admitted in Court as Exhibit P6A.[^141] Hence, Thenmolli was recalled to give further evidence concerning her communication history with several individuals in P6A.

78     In relation to her communications with a person known as “Wan” on 19 and 20 October 2015, during which Thenmolli provided the Accused’s DBS savings account number to Wan, Thenmolli testified that she could not remember what the conversation was about but it involved her asking Wan to transfer money to the Accused’s account.[^142] Regarding the figures such as “3200” and “$1600” mentioned in her text messages with Wan, Thenmolli denied that the number 3200 represented the price of drugs that she was sending to Wan. However, she agreed that she had asked Wan to transfer $1600 into the Accused’s account. When pressed, Thenmolli declined to reveal what the money was for, except to insist that it was not for drugs.[^143] She subsequently explained that as it was nearing Deepavali then, her communications with Wan were in relation to the business she was doing together with her mother.[^144] When queried by the Court, Thenmolli agreed that she had also sent a text message with Wan’s number to the Accused on 31 October 2015.[^145]

79     P6A showed that Thenmolli had made numerous calls to the drug supplier’s Malaysian phone number on 29 October, 31 October, 2 November and 3 November 2015. Although Thenmolli admitted to making those calls, she claimed that she could not recall what the calls were about. She also denied that they were in relation to drugs. In addition, Thenmolli claimed that she would not make any calls to the drug supplier out of her own initiative.[^146] P6A also showed that Thenmolli received a number of calls from the drug supplier as well as the Accused on both 2 and 3 November 2015. Although Thenmolli could not recall the contents of these phone calls, she agreed that the Accused’s calls on 2 November 2015 were in relation to the drug supplier.[^147]

80     When she was further cross-examined by the Defence, Thenmolli agreed that P6A showed that she had about 60 dialled or received calls with the drug supplier.[^148] Thenmolli said that all her calls with the drug supplier “involved” the Accused because the supplier was the Accused’s friend and he would be asking for the Accused.[^149]

81     When shown text messages dated 27 October 2015 in which Thenmolli had sent her sister Bhavani’s phone number to the drug supplier and the drug supplier’s number to Bhavani, Thenmolli testified that she could not remember sending the messages.[^150]

82     Thenmolli was also cross-examined about her communications with a contact named “Expo” in P6A. Thenmolli explained that he was a distant cousin and a friend but denied they were talking about drugs.[^151] During re-examination, when shown Exhibit P1, which contained data extracted from the Accused’s phone (Exhibit P2), Thenmolli agreed that Expo’s phone number was found under the contact name “Gurd Work Part Time”. However, she did not think Expo was working for the Accused.[^152]

## The Case for the Defence

83     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that the Prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the Trafficking Charge[^153]. As such I called upon the Accused to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify.

### The Accused’s evidence

84     The Accused testified that his defence to the Trafficking Charge was that he did not share a common intention to traffic the drugs with Thenmolli.[^154]

#### Accused was released from prison

85     The Accused was released from prison on 4 September 2015. Soon thereafter he started working as a chef at a fine-dining restaurant earning about $2000 per month. He continued working until late November 2015.[^155]

#### Accused learnt of Thenmolli’s involvement in drugs

86     The Accused first got to know Thenmolli in 2008 when their father suffered a heart attack. Sometime in August 2015, the Accused’s mother visited him in prison and informed him that Thenmolli’s boyfriend was arrested for drug trafficking. After the Accused was released from prison, the Accused called Thenmolli and learnt that she was in Singapore to visit her boyfriend in prison. Thenmolli told the Accused that her business venture failed and she was in debt. She approached a friend named “Puteh” (later ascertained to be the drug supplier) for help. He in turn offered her money in return for bringing drugs into Singapore. However, as a result of her receiving counterfeit money for a consignment of drugs, she owed the drug supplier a large sum of money, on top of her business debts. As such, she had to work harder to bring in more drugs.[^156]

87     The Accused discussed Thenmolli’s situation with her mother and both of them thought it would be best for Thenmolli to move in and stay with the Accused in Singapore. Subsequently, after the Accused posted some photographs taken with Thenmolli in his Facebook account, Karim, a friend the Accused got to know in prison, questioned the Accused about Thenmolli. Karim told the Accused that Thenmolli was a drug courier who had been supplying drugs to him.[^157]

88     Subsequently, the Accused’s mother learnt of Thenmolli’s drug issue and told both the Accused and Thenmolli to move out. The Accused and Thenmolli had planned to go to Malaysia on 26 November 2015 to make payment for a rental house.[^158]

89     According to the Accused, both Expo and Wan were Thenmolli’s customers.[^159] On one occasion, Thenmolli informed the Accused that one of her customers, Wan, had “accidentally” transferred money into his account. The Accused proceeded to transfer the money back. The Accused had never met nor spoken with Wan.[^160]

#### Accused stored the drug supplier’s phone number in his phone

90     The Accused explained that Thenmolli had tried to call the drug supplier using his phone sometime in September 2015. The Accused saved the supplier’s phone number in his phone thereafter as “Dog Hunter”.[^161] The Accused had met the drug supplier (whom he addressed as “Puteh”) on a few occasions in Malaysia. The first time was when he handed the drug supplier some money on Thenmolli’s behalf.[^162]

91     During cross-examination, the Accused acknowledged that Exhibit P20 showed that he received 3 calls in his phone from the drug supplier on 19 September 2015,[^163] while Exhibit P1A showed that he had sent the drug supplier’s number to Thenmolli on 5 October 2015.[^164] The Accused also agreed that based on the evidence available before the Court, the earliest communication between Thenmolli and the drug supplier was on 27 October 2015.[^165] However, the Accused insisted that Thenmolli had in fact been communicating with the drug supplier even before his release from prison.[^166] As for why the Accused had to send the drug supplier’s number to Thenmolli when, according to him, she already had the number, the Accused explained as follows:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

So, if she had the number in the first place, there’ll be no reason for you to send ‘Dog Hunter’s’ number to her. Correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Because you see down there, uh, Your Honour, if I’m not wrong 164, I think---because my sister has a tendency of leaving her phone here and there, you know. So, that’s why I’m talking to her---to my sister, “You go and take your phone from my younger sister”, you know.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

I---sorry, I don’t understand you.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Because some---my sister got 2 phone, right, Your Honour. Sometimes, she will leave 1 phone at Malaysia, then she will enter into Singapore. Then, she needs something then, I will help her out, lah. Like example, my last sister number or my mother’s number or anybody. Then I will SMS it to her or WhatsApp it to her, lah. So that’s why I think I’m talking to her in 164.[^167]

 |

  
  

92     The Accused also agreed that he had sent the drug supplier’s number to his contact “Kicah” on 27 September 2015 as well. According to the Accused, this was “maybe” due to Thenmolli asking him to send the number.[^168]

#### Accused was involved in drug trafficking with Thenmolli

93     The Accused acknowledged that in a series of text messages from 10 to 12 October 2015, he was communicating with Thenmolli concerning both of them earning money from drugs and splitting a sum of $4800 received in a drug transaction. The Accused had also asked Thenmolli how much the courier’s payment would be.[^169] However, the Accused disputed that the $1800 given to him was his share of the earnings as he was merely requested by Thenmolli to hold on to the money for her.[^170]

94     The Accused agreed that his text message communications with Thenmolli on 11 and 12 October 2015 also showed that his mother thought he was selling drugs, and Thenmolli was concerned with him abusing drugs whilst at the same time earning money from drug trafficking. The Accused told the Court that this was because he was indeed selling drugs and involved in drug trafficking with Thenmolli at the material time.[^171]

#### Accused got to know Praveen through Thenmolli

95     After Karim was arrested for a drug related offence in October 2015, the Accused informed Thenmolli about it. Thenmolli told the Accused that she had found someone named Praveen to work for her. The Accused then advised Thenmolli not to let Praveen think that he was working for her but instead, have him think that he was working for somebody else. As such, Thenmolli asked the Accused for help to call and speak to Praveen. The Accused then used Thenmolli’s phone to call Praveen. He asked Praveen “Did my sister explain to you what’s going to happen?” and Praveen said “Yes”.[^172]

#### Accused was involved in drug transactions with Praveen

96     The Accused admitted that his only dealings with Praveen concerned drugs.[^173] He had been involved in 2 drug transactions where Praveen acted as courier, prior to the one in the Trafficking Charge.[^174] The first transaction took place in Defu Lane on 3 November 2015. According to the Accused, he was sent to the location at Defu Lane to collect money on Thenmolli’s behalf. However, when he arrived, the other party wanted to “push the drugs into \[his\] hand”. After consulting Thenmolli, the Accused called Praveen and instructed him to collect and deliver the drugs.[^175] The second transaction was on 5 November and the Accused was the one who instructed Praveen on how to go to his flat to drop the drugs off.[^176]

97     The Accused also admitted to paying Praveen in relation to 3 previous drug transactions prior to 24 November 2015; he gave Praveen $300 cash on 3 November 2015, left Praveen $300 in the shoe rack on 5 November 2015, and transferred $300 to Praveen on 12 November 2015 after Praveen had sent him a text message with a POSB savings account number. However, he claimed that he was not Praveen’s paymaster and that he was making payment to Praveen on Thenmolli’s behalf.[^177]

#### Accused learnt that drugs were coming into Singapore and decided to disrupt the delivery

98     According to the Accused, he had some issues with Thenmolli regarding drugs. He made a sudden decision to go to Bangkok and asked Thenmolli to leave his flat and return to Malaysia.[^178]

99     On 23 November 2015, after the Accused returned to Singapore, he met up with Thenmolli at “Tekka”. Before returning to Malaysia, Thenmolli gave the Accused some money. She also informed the Accused that she had “work to do” and the Accused understood that to mean that there were drugs coming into Singapore and the drugs would be placed in the shoe rack outside his flat. The Accused decided to disrupt the drug delivery so that the supplier would not trust Thenmolli anymore.[^179]

100    As the drugs were to be sent to the shoe rack outside the Accused’s flat, his role was to inform the suppliers that it was safe to send the drugs there. As such, the Accused’s plan was to stop picking up the drug supplier’s calls on 26 November 2015 so as to cause them to think that something was wrong and not send the drugs into Singapore.[^180]

101    Pursuant to his plan, the Accused told Thenmolli to keep him informed about the transaction. As such, later on the same day, Thenmolli and the Accused made several calls to each other between 3.41pm and 5.38pm to discuss the movement of the drugs.[^181] The Accused also called the drug supplier at about 7.23pm to enquire about the drug transaction.[^182] Following that, there were further calls from Thenmolli at 7.52pm and the drug supplier at 9.43pm and 10.57pm concerning the transaction.[^183]

#### Accused consumed drugs on 23 and 24 November 2015

102    After returning to Singapore on 23 November 2015, the Accused stayed in Hotel 81 in Upper Serangoon area because he did not want to stay at home. According to the Accused, he was consuming “Ice” with a friend throughout the night from 23 to 24 November 2015. In fact, the Accused had been consuming drugs on and off since his release from prison and during his trip to Thailand. As such, when his urine was tested after his arrest, it was positive for controlled drugs.[^184]

103    On 24 November 2015, the Accused called Thenmolli again at 12.29pm to find out what was happening.[^185]

#### Accused made payment to Praveen for the transaction in the Trafficking Charge

104    As Thenmolli had made a request to the Accused on 23 November 2015 to transfer money to Praveen, the Accused called Praveen on 24 November 2015 at 10pm and asked for his account number. In response, Praveen sent the Accused a text message with a POSB savings account number. The Accused later called Praveen at 11.09pm on 24 November 2015 to inform him that the money had been transferred.[^186]

105    The Accused explained that he had transferred the money on Thenmolli’s behalf because she did not have her own bank account. As such, Thenmolli would pass him $300 cash and he would transfer the amount to Praveen.[^187] The Accused agreed that this payment was for Praveen’s role as a courier for the transaction in the Trafficking Charge. He explained that he was “forced” to make the payment so as not to arouse Thenmolli’s suspicions and result in a change of plans for the delivery.[^188]

#### The events of 25 November 2015

106    In the morning of 25 November 2015, the Accused made 3 calls to Praveen at 4.55am, 6.18am and 6.42am. However, he could not recall what he spoke to Praveen about. However, on that day, the Accused recalled relaying information he received from Thenmolli and the drug supplier to Praveen.[^189]

107    In addition, the Accused also called the drug supplier at 10.44am to ask for further information about the drug transaction and to check on arrangements the supplier was making.[^190] After this call, the Accused attempted to contact Thenmolli (at 10.44am and 3.10pm) and finally managed to speak to her at 3.14pm to discuss what the drug supplier had told him earlier.[^191]

108    Following this, the Accused made 3 calls to the drug supplier (at 5.01pm, 5.18pm and 5.23pm) but could not reach him. Thereafter, the Accused called Thenmolli twice at 5.24pm and 5.58pm to question her about what was happening. Subsequently Thenmolli also called the Accused at 7.52pm. As Thenmolli had told the Accused to inform Praveen to be on standby, the Accused called Praveen at 6.39pm and 9.14pm to relay Thenmolli’s message to him.[^192]

#### The events of 26 November 2015

109    On 26 November 2015, at 4.49am, the Accused called Praveen to check whether he was awake and to wake him up. Following that, the Accused called the drug supplier twice, at 5.00am and 5.09am to ask about the status of the drug transaction.[^193] As the drug supplier told the Accused that they were still on the way and had yet to make arrangements, the Accused sent a text message to Praveen at 5.45am informing him that there was still time and to “rest for a bit”. Praveen responded at 6.09am apologising for the late reply stating that he was showering earlier.[^194]

110    Sometime after this, the Accused fell asleep. At 8.35am, Praveen sent two text messages to the Accused asking the Accused to call him once the Accused woke up, and informing the Accused that he was on his way to Tuas West Road.[^195]

111    The Accused slept for about 7 hours.[^196] When the Accused woke up, he saw that he had many missed calls, including those from Praveen. In fact, the Accused acknowledged that his phone records showed that he had 13 missed calls from the drug supplier from 6.45am to 8.13am, three missed calls from Thenmolli from 8.07am to 8.08am and eight missed calls from Praveen from 8.21am to 8.34am and one more at 11.47am. In addition, there were also several missed calls from his contact named “Stephen”.

112    The Accused returned Praveen’s call and asked Praveen what happened. Praveen told the Accused that he was outside the Accused’s flat. Immediately after the call ended, the Accused took his key, opened the gate and went outside the flat. The Accused searched through the shoe rack and found a green plastic bag in a lower compartment. He knew it was drugs and did not want the drugs to be collected by anybody. By the time the Accused “realised what \[he\] was doing”, he was standing inside his room. The Accused immediately took the bag and emptied the contents into the rubbish chute. At that time, the Accused was unsure what kind of drugs were in the green plastic bag and also did not know how much drugs there were.[^197]

113    During cross-examination, the Accused acknowledged that he had called Praveen at 12.21pm and “immediately” went to retrieve the drugs from the shoe rack and threw them away. Following this, he made three attempts to call “Stephen” at 12.22pm, 12.24pm and 12.25pm.[^198]

114    Sometime after disposing the drugs and replying to the missed calls and text messages, the Accused went to brush his teeth. As he looked out of the kitchen window, he saw SSSgt Au Yong and they made eye contact. When the Accused noticed that SSSgt Au Yong and another officer were unloading house- raiding tools (specifically an electric saw) and they were running towards his void deck, he became suspicious that they were enforcement officers who were going after him.[^199]

### Thenmolli’s evidence on P1A

115    As Exhibit P1A, which contained further data extracted from the Accused’s phone, was only admitted in Court during the Defence’s case, the Defence made an application to recall Thenmolli a second time, so as to cross-examine her on P1A. I allowed the application with a view to affording the Defence a fair chance to further cross-examine her on her communications with the Accused.

116    Thenmolli agreed that some of her text messages with the Accused on 18 and 19 September 2015 concerned payment for drugs but denied that she was the supplier of the drugs.[^200] Thenmolli also denied knowing Karim or that she supplied drugs to him.[^201]

117    When referred to the messages dated 11 October 2015 concerning the payment of $4800, she agreed that this was for a drug transaction.[^202] Thenmolli also acknowledged that she knew the drug supplier as “Puteh”. However, she testified that he was the Accused’s friend and that she had never met him before. Nonetheless, she agreed that the sum of $3000 mentioned in the text messages were to be paid to Puteh, and her previous communications with Puteh related to him supplying cannabis to her.[^203]

## Analysis of the evidence and the Court’s findings

118    As mentioned earlier in these grounds, it was clear from the evidence that there was no dispute that the Accused was in physical possession of the drugs in the Trafficking Charge shortly before his arrest. After the drugs were delivered by Praveen to the shoe rack outside his flat, the Accused had personally retrieved them and brought them into his flat. Thus, my analysis and findings would be focused on the following issues:

> (a)     whether the Accused knew the nature of the drugs;

> (b)     whether the Accused intended to traffic in the drugs; and

> (c)     whether the Accused shared a common intention with Thenmolli.to commit the offence.

119    Before discussing my findings on the issues in contention, it would be useful to review the evidence before the Court in relation to these elements of the Trafficking Charge.

### Weight to be given to Praveen’s statements in P36, P37 and P38

120    I shall first turn to Praveen’s statements in P36, P37 and P38 which the Prosecution tendered to impeach his credit and to substitute his testimony with. In determining the weight to be placed on these statements, I had regard to the factors stated in section 147(6) of the Evidence Act:

> “147. -- …

> (6)    In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.”

121    In my view, it could not be disputed that Praveen’s statements, recorded on 30 November 2015 and 3 December 2015 respectively, were given contemporaneously with the occurrence of the material events stated therein, and in particular, within a few days of the drug transaction relating to the Trafficking Charge.

122    I also found that Praveen had no incentive to deliberately conceal or misrepresent facts in his statements. Praveen had fully admitted to his own role and involvement, not only in relation to the transaction on the day of his arrest, but also in several other drug transactions prior to that. He therefore had nothing to gain by falsely implicating the Accused. As observed by the Prosecution in their closing submissions, it was clear from the contents of Praveen’s statements that he was doing nothing more than to set out an accurate account of events. He did not seek to absolve himself, shield Thenmolli or push all the blame to the Accused.[^204] I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there was no evidence to suggest that Praveen’s statements were involuntarily given or inaccurately recorded.[^205] On the contrary, Insp Aliff and Mr Raman had both testified that the statements were voluntarily given by Praveen.

123    I tested Praveen’s statements against the evidence given by other witnesses, including the Accused, and the objective evidence such as the bank and phone records, and found a high degree of accuracy in many details. Besides the cogent examples set out by the Prosecution in their closing submissions on how Praveen’s account accorded with the objective evidence from 24 to 26 November 2015[^206], there were various other instances where Praveen’s version dovetailed with extrinsic evidence. For example, in \[19\] and \[20\] of P37, Praveen mentioned that Thenmolli had called and told him that her god-brother was dealing in drugs and needed people to work for him. Subsequently, towards the end of October, the Accused called him and introduced himself as Thenmolli’s god-brother and asked whether he was interested in the work mentioned by Thenmolli. In my view, this was amply supported by the objective evidence in P1A, which showed that on 30 October 2015, Thenmolli had sent the Accused a text message with a phone number and Praveen’s name, followed by 3 messages as follows: “Just nw he text me asking what u said”, “I told him I pass the num to u” and “U see hw la”. This clearly alluded to Thenmolli having a preliminary discussion with Praveen in relation to working for the Accused, following which she asked the Accused to contact Praveen. In fact, P20 showed that the Accused subsequently called Praveen on 2 November 2015 and spoke to him for 9 minutes and 9 seconds.[^207]

124    In another example, Praveen stated in P37 that he first worked for the Accused as a drug courier in the first week of November, 5 to 6 days before Deepavali (which fell on 10 November 2015). He went to Defu Lane and was given $300 by the Accused as his salary.[^208] When shown the phone records of 3 November 2015 which detailed a number of calls between the Accused and Praveen, the Accused admitted in Court that 3 November 2015 was the date of the Defu Lane transaction. The Accused also admitted that he had called Praveen to assist in that transaction, and subsequently paid Praveen $300 from the drug money he collected.[^209]

125    The Accused also admitted that he was involved in the second transaction detailed by Praveen which concerned delivering drugs to the shoe rack outside the Accused’s flat; and that he had left cash of $300 in the shoe rack for Praveen.[^210] In fact, after being referred to the phone records of 5 November 2015 which showed a number of calls the Accused had with Praveen, the drug supplier and Thenmolli, the Accused informed the Court that this was the date of Praveen’s second job, and further, that he was the one who told Praveen how to go to his flat in Tampines.[^211]

126    Finally, even though the Accused disputed Praveen’s account of him receiving instructions from the Accused in relation to the third transaction which occurred 2 to 3 days after Deepavali, the objective evidence again showed a large volume of calls between the Accused and Praveen from 6.07am to 12.16pm on 13 November 2015.[^212] To me, the Accused’s explanation that Thenmolli was the one communicating with Praveen using his phone was simply not credible, given that many of these calls were interspersed with, and proximate in time to, a number of calls which the Accused admitted to have had with his contact “Stephen”.

127    Further, while Praveen could have mixed up the occasion when the Accused left him cash in the shoe rack with another occasion when the Accused transferred payment into the bank account, the Accused admitted to leaving cash for Praveen in the shoe rack (on 5 November 2015 for the second transaction) and transferring money to Praveen’s girlfriend’s account (on 12 November 2015 for the third transaction). In fact, the Accused admitted that he was the one who made payment to Praveen for all 4 transactions (including the one in relation to the Trafficking Charge), which accorded with what Praveen said in his statements. In my view any inaccuracy in Praveen’s statements were attributable to human fallibility in recollection. They were not material in nature and did not indicate any motive on Praveen’s part to deliberately lie and falsely implicate the Accused.

128    Having thoroughly examined Praveen’s statements, I was satisfied that they should be given full weight.

### Weight to be given to the Accused’s statement in P22

129    Next, I shall touch on the Accused’s statement in P22, which was admitted after the ancillary hearing.

130    In my view, my decision to admit P22 was fortified by subsequent developments in the main trial. It was pertinent to note that the allegations made against the voluntariness of P22 included threats allegedly uttered to the Accused by SI Yeo one day earlier, on 1 Dec 2015, during the recording of P23. According to the Accused, when P23 was recorded, SI Yeo had threatened him by making reference to DNA evidence, the death sentence and the “COC”. The Accused claimed that the threats uttered on 1 December 2015 were constantly on his mind and he felt threatened throughout the recording of his statements. It was thus interesting to note that subsequent to the admission of P22, the Defence decided to admit P23 (which was redacted by the Prosecution) fully into evidence as Exhibit D4. More significantly, the Defence proceeded to rely substantially on the contents of D4 in their closing submissions (“Defence’s Closing Submissions”) in support of the Accused’s defence.[^213] Assuming that the Defence would not have sought to admit a statement made by the Accused under threat and relied extensively on its contents as the truth, this, in my view, served to cast doubt on the Accused’s allegations of threats uttered by SI Yeo. Conversely, the admission of D4 as a defence exhibit buttressed my finding that P22 was a voluntary statement recorded by the same officer the very next day.

131    In addition, the Defence also admitted another statement recorded from the Accused by SI Yeo on 3 December 2015 into evidence as Exhibit D5. It was pertinent to note that the first paragraph of D5 stated as follows:

> “48    My previous statement recorded on 2 December 2015 was given to me as I had requested from IO Victor Yeo that I wanted to read the statement myself. I affirm that it is my statement and I did not want to make any changes to the statement.”

132    Again, this served to affirm that P22 was voluntarily given by the Accused and accurately recorded.

133    Further, one of the challenges mounted by the Accused against the veracity of P22 was that he was falling asleep intermittently when the statement was recorded as he had not slept for 4 days and had been consuming drugs. However, this was directly contradicted subsequently by the Accused’s own testimony in the main trial that he had slept for about 7 hours until shortly before his arrest. [^214]

134    The Defence in their closing submissions[^215] also pointed to the Accused and Thenmolli’s evidence that Mdm Malliga had bought food for them when their statements were recorded.[^216] To me, this was neither here nor there and did not have any bearing on the voluntariness or the accuracy of the Accused’s statement in P22. It was pertinent to note that it was never put to Insp Yeo or Mdm Malliga that Mdm Malliga bought food for the Accused and Thenmolli. During the ancillary hearing, SI Yeo was never asked whether he bought food for the Accused. On the contrary, the allegation that was put directly to Mdm Malliga was that it was Insp Yeo who bought food for the Accused to eat. In any event, it was never the Accused’s case that this gesture from Mdm Malliga (or Insp Yeo) had any bearing on the voluntariness or accuracy of his statement in P22. In a final twist to this episode regarding food, when SI Yeo was recalled to the stand in the main trial, he candidly shared in Court that he was the one who bought food for the Accused just before the Accused’s statement was recorded.[^217]

135    Based on the above, I was satisfied that P22 was voluntarily and accurately recorded from the Accused.

### Thenmolli had no reason to frame the Accused for the Trafficking Charge

136    Thenmolli had consistently testified that she had introduced Praveen to the Accused in October 2015 to work for the Accused and that the drugs in the Trafficking Charge were ordered by the Accused. At the same time, she also admitted to voluntarily assisting to facilitate the transaction on 26 November 2015 while the Accused was asleep.

137    When considering Thenmolli’s evidence I was mindful that she was an accomplice in the offence. In addition, she appeared to have attempted to downplay her own relationship with the drug supplier and her involvement in other drug transactions. However, having scrutinised her evidence very carefully, it was clear to me that Thenmolli did not at any time seek to minimise her role and involvement in the transaction relating to the Trafficking Charge. Indeed, not only was Thenmolli’s version corroborated by Praveen’s account in his statements, it was also consistent with other objective evidence, including the communication records. As highlighted by the Prosecution in their closing submissions, there was no evidence to show that Thenmolli had called Praveen on 24 or 25 November 2015, in the lead up to the transaction on 26 November 2015. In fact, if this order of drugs were solely hers as alleged by the Defence, one would have expected her to keep in close contact with Praveen, who was to be the courier for the drugs. On the contrary, Praveen’s phone records showed that his first communication with Thenmolli during this period was on the morning of 26 November 2015 at about 8.12am.[^218] The evidence also showed that this call was made by Thenmolli to Praveen only after a series of missed calls from the drug supplier and Thenmolli to the Accused.

138    Various other material aspects of Thenmolli’s testimony also found support in extrinsic evidence. As highlighted by the Prosecution in their closing submissions, Thenmolli’s position that the drug supplier was the Accused’s friend was supported by the Accused’s phone records showing that a text message containing the drug supplier’s number was sent from his phone to Thenmolli on 5 October 2015.[^219]

139    Indeed, Thenmolli, like Praveen, had no reason to deliberately lie against the Accused in Court. Thenmolli had pleaded guilty to and was sentenced for her role in the Trafficking Charge. Her appeal against sentence was concluded in April 2018, well before she testified for the first time in Court in June 2018. Having had the benefit of observing Thenmolli give her evidence in Court, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that it was evident that she treasured her close bond and loving relationship with the Accused.[^220] Even the Accused himself was hard-put to provide a reason for Thenmolli to falsely implicate him, and could only allude vaguely to some fanciful idea of Thenmolli “crossing her finger and thinking there’s some miracle or something might happen”[^221].

140    In their closing submissions, the Defence pointed to Thenmolli’s return to the Tampines flat, without a key in her possession, as supporting evidence that the drugs delivered were hers alone.[^222] The Defence also made much of Thenmolli’s reference to a key on the switch box during her testimony. In my view, it was important to put Thenmolli’s evidence into context. To be clear, Thenmolli agreed that she had lost her set of keys to the flat but her evidence was not that she expected there to be a key placed there for her on 26 November 2015. Her evidence, taken in context, was that this was how she entered the flat for the first time.[^223] However, the Defence had seized upon her mention of the key and put it to her that the key was never placed on the switch box at any point of time.[^224] This was later demonstrated to be untrue. When shown text messages from his own phone dated 29 and 30 September 2015, the Accused agreed that on the first occasion Thenmolli came to his flat, he had indeed placed a key on the switch box and provided instructions to her on how to retrieve the key to enter the flat.[^225] In my opinion, the Defence had missed the point Thenmolli was making in her testimony. As set out in greater detail earlier in these grounds, Thenmolli’s evidence was that she assumed (correctly) that the Accused was asleep in his flat. Further, she had mentioned to him the night before that she would be coming to Singapore to visit her boyfriend. As such, she thought she could just call him or knock on the door for him to open it for her.

141    In the Defence’s submissions, it was suggested that “\[t\]he failure of Thenmolli to have even attempted to contact both the Accused and/or the Accused’s mother \[was\] so glaring – that she did not have any intention to enter the flat”.[^226] I should point out that, as mentioned by Thenmolli in her evidence, and as highlighted by the Defence during the Accused’s examination-in-chief, Thenmolli did in fact attempt to contact the Accused after the drugs were delivered, and before going to the flat – by sending him a message at 12.46pm to ask him to call her.[^227]

142    In my view, the objective evidence, including Praveen reporting to the Accused that he was on his way to Tuas West Road[^228] and his attempt to call the Accused at 11.47am after he had dropped off the drugs[^229] before sending Thenmolli a message stating “\[w\]ork done”[^230], clearly corroborated Thenmolli’s evidence of the Accused’s involvement in the present transaction. In my opinion, Thenmolli’s trip to the Accused’s flat, some time after the drugs were delivered[^231], was equally, if not more consistent with the fact that both she and the Accused shared a common intention in this transaction.

143    In view of the above, I agreed with the Prosecution that Thenmolli’s implication of the Accused in relation to the Trafficking Charge should be given full weight.

144    Having dealt with the weight to be ascribed to the material evidence in this case, I shall now turn to consider the issues in contention.

### Accused knew that the drugs were cannabis

145    I agreed with the Prosecution’s observations in their closing submissions that the Accused had clearly admitted in P22 that he knew that the green plastic bag which he retrieved from his shoe rack contained two bundles of cannabis:[^232]

> “I quickly went back into my house with the green coloured plastic bag. I locked the metal gate and wooden door of my house. I carried the green coloured plastic bag in my hand. I opened up the green coloured plastic bag to see the content while I was walking back into my room. I saw one ‘GNC’ plastic bag containing two NTUC plastic bags. In one of the NTUC plastic bag, there was one block wrapped in aluminium foil and in another NTUC plastic bag, I saw one small green coloured plastic bag containing one block wrapped in aluminium foil. **I knew that the two blocks wrapped in aluminium foils were ‘ganja’.** I meant cannabis when I said ‘ganja’.”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

146    I was satisfied that I could give full weight to this admission on the part of the Accused. After all, P22 was, in essence, an exculpatory statement in which the Accused alleged that the cannabis belonged to Thenmolli and he had wanted to throw them away.[^233]

147    Furthermore, the Accused’s knowledge that the drugs were cannabis was consistent with, and supported by, Thenmolli’s testimony that she had introduced Praveen to work for the Accused in trafficking cannabis. The Accused had also admitted that in P22 that he had previously used the weighing scale in Exhibit P42 to weigh cannabis before cutting blocks of cannabis into half.[^234]

148    Indeed, based on the Accused’s own version in Court, he was actively gathering information on this particular drug transaction by calling both Thenmolli and the drug supplier repeatedly over a few days. Hence, his claim that he did not even know the type of drugs involved in the transaction was simply not credible and beggared belief. As such, I found that the Accused knew that the drugs in his possession was cannabis.

### The Accused intended to traffic in the drugs and shared a common intention with Thenmolli to commit the offence

149    As the issues concerning the Accused’s common intention with Thenmolli and his intention to traffic in the drugs were intertwined, I shall deal with them together.

150    Section 17(d) of the MDA states:

> **“17**.    Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than –

> …

>> (d)    15 grammes of cannabis;

>> \---

> whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture, shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.”

151    Thus, based the amount of cannabis in the Accused’s possession, the Accused was presumed under section 17(d) of the MDA (until the contrary was proved) to have had the cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

152    In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the Accused’s intention to traffic the drugs was supported by his previous involvement in drug trafficking transactions. The evidence (including his own) revealed a pattern of drug dealing involving both Thenmolli and Praveen which the Accused made no effort to disengage from.[^235]

153    I shall now turn to deal with the central plank of the Accused’s defence, which was his alleged intention to disrupt the drug transaction in the Trafficking Charge.

#### Accused’s alleged attempts to disrupt the transaction were not supported by evidence

154    In the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the Defence contended that the Accused had _testified_ to at least 6 occasions where he had attempted to disrupt Thenmolli’s drug trafficking activities.[^236] I shall deal with the Accused’s alleged attempts to disrupt the transaction before 26 November 2015:

##### (1)   First occasion: The Accused left for Thailand

155    According to the Defence, the first occasion when the Accused attempted to disrupt the drug transaction was when he left for Thailand so that Thenmolli could not use his flat as a drop off for drugs.[^237]

156    Firstly, contrary to the Defence’s assertions, the Accused had never testified in Court that that he went to Thailand for this purpose. Instead, this was something the Accused mentioned in his statement in D4.[^238] Even in D4, the Accused did not say that he went to Thailand so that Thenmolli could not use his Tampines flat as a drop off for drugs. Instead, his explanation then was that she would not be able to coordinate the drugs into Singapore “so easily” as she would not be able to stay in his house.

157    In his evidence in Court, the Accused merely stated that there were “certain issues” between him and Thenmolli regarding drugs so he suddenly made a decision to go to Bangkok and asked her to go back to Malaysia so that she would not be able to stay in his house. There was no mention that his trip to Thailand had anything to do with disrupting drug trafficking.

##### (2)   Second occasion: The Accused stayed at Hotel 81

158    According to the Defence, on 24 November 2015 when Thenmolli passed the Accused money for Praveen, the Accused chose to stay at Hotel 81 instead of his home so that drug deliveries could not be sent there.[^239]

159    Again, contrary to the Defence’s submissions, the Accused never gave evidence to this effect. This was clearly drawn from the contents of D4, where the Accused said he stayed in the hotel to avoid Thenmolli so that she could not coordinate her drug delivery through his flat.[^240]

160    In Court, the only reason the Accused gave for staying in Hotel 81 was that he did not want to stay at home and that he was smoking Ice at the hotel with a friend. In fact, contrary to D4, the Accused stated that he stayed in the hotel on 23 November 2015 _after_ Thenmolli gave him money _and went back to Malaysia_. Thus, there was clearly no need to avoid Thenmolli by staying in a hotel as she was not even going to remain in Singapore.

161    There was also no evidence to indicate that the Accused was trying to avoid Thenmolli at all on 23 November 2015. To the contrary, the Accused’s testimony in Court was that subsequent to his meeting with Thenmolli on 23 November 2015, they made several calls to each other between 3.41pm and 5.38pm to discuss the movement of the drugs. The Accused also called the drug supplier at about 7.23pm to enquire about the drug transaction. Following that, there were further calls from Thenmolli at 7.52pm and the drug supplier at 9.43pm and 10.57pm concerning the same.

##### (3)   Third occasion: The Accused did not answer calls from drug supplier and Thenmolli on the morning of 25 November 2015

162    The Defence alleged that the Accused deliberately chose not to answer calls from the drug supplier and Thenmolli in the morning of 25 November 2015 by giving them the excuse that he had overslept.[^241] Yet again, this did not accord with the Accused’s testimony in Court but was drawn from the contents of D4.[^242] In addition, in his testimony in Court, the Accused did not point to any phone records showing that he did not pick up calls from Thenmolli or the drug supplier that morning. Instead, the communication records showed that the Accused made several calls to Praveen on 25 November at about 4.55am, 6.18am and 6.42am. These calls accorded with Praveen’s statement in P36 where he said that the Accused had called to wake him up that morning and called again at about 6.30am to ask him to go and collect drugs.[^243] This certainly ran contrary to any claim on the Accused’s part that he was minded to disrupt the drug transaction that morning.

##### (4)   Fourth occasion: The Accused told the drug supplier that he was busy and the drugs could not come in

163    The Defence submitted that the fourth occasion was on the evening of 25 November 2015 when the Accused told the drug supplier and Thenmolli that he was busy and the drugs could not come in.[^244]

164    Again, this was not the Accused’s account in Court, but was taken from D4.[^245] In D4, the Accused stated that he told the drug supplier that he was busy. He also told Thenmolli that the drug delivery could not be done because it was not a good timing and Thenmolli agreed.

165    In fact, this was directly contradicted by the Accused’s evidence in Court. When shown the phone records for 25 November 2015, the Accused testified that he called the supplier at 10am to ask for information about the drug transaction and called Thenmolli at 3.14pm to tell her what the supplier told him. Thereafter, the Accused called Thenmolli twice, around 5pm, to question her on what was happening, and Thenmolli told him to inform Praveen to be on standby. As for his call to Praveen at around 6pm and 9pm, the Accused testified that he was relaying information from Thenmolli and the supplier to Praveen. Clearly, the Accused never testified to any attempt to disrupt the transaction that evening by claiming he was busy. Instead, he was actively engaging the supplier and Thenmolli and relaying information from them to Praveen.

166    In summary, the Accused’s self-professed intention to disrupt the drug transaction in the Trafficking Charge was internally inconsistent, self-contradictory and not supported by evidence.

167    The Accused’s proposed methodology of disruption also did not accord with common sense and logic. In his testimony, he explained that he knew the drugs would be delivered to his flat in Tampines. As such, he engaged in communications with the drug supplier in order to gain information about the transaction. His plan was to go to sleep and abruptly cease communications thereafter so as to cause the drug supplier to think there was something wrong with the transaction and lose trust in Thenmolli. During cross-examination, the Accused admitted that he was doing all the coordinating earlier in the morning of 26 March 2015 and Thenmolli did not participate.[^246] He also admitted that she only stepped in at a later stage because he was asleep.[^247] When asked to explain, the Accused was unable to give a coherent explanation as to how, if he were the one who suddenly withdrew from communicating with the supplier, the supplier would lose trust in Thenmolli:[^248]

Q

 | 

So, if anything went wrong, they might well, it’s more likely that the Malaysian side will have lost the trust in you, not lost their trust in your sister ‘cause you were the one liaising with them on that morning, correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I took ---I mean, I took over---I mean, I---I was doing things on behalf of my sister, Your Honour. So, at the end of the day---I mean, the previous day already, it was disrupted already. He’s supposed to come in, but he didn’t come in at all. Then the following morning also, what my intention was, again, something similar happened, then they would not trust her anymore and give it to her.

 |

  
  

168    In reality, the phone records showed that when the Accused fell asleep, the drug supplier persisted in making numerous calls from 6.45am to about 8am to contact him, well before Thenmolli came into the picture and attempted to call the Accused herself at about 8am. Clearly, the drug supplier, far from losing trust in Thenmolli, turned to her for assistance when he could not contact the Accused. This went to show how illogical and untenable the Accused’s proposed scheme was.

#### The Accused participated actively in facilitating the drug transaction

169    The weight of the evidence (including his own) pointed at the Accused taking steps in, and actively facilitating, the very drug transaction he claimed he wished to disrupt. When being shown the phone records, the Accused testified that he had called the supplier on 23 November 2018 to enquire about the drugs that he understood would be deposited in the shoe rack outside his house. The next day, he called Praveen to ask for his account number so as to transfer the payment for the upcoming drug delivery to Praveen. After transferring the money, the Accused called to inform Praveen. On 25 November, the Accused called the drug supplier again in the morning to ask for information about the drug transaction. As detailed earlier in these grounds, he later relayed the information to Praveen and told him to be on standby. On 26 November 2015, at about 4.50am, the Accused called Praveen to check whether he was awake. He then called the supplier twice at about 5am to 5.09am to ask for information. At 5.45am, based on the information he had received, the Accused told Praveen that there was still time and asked him to rest for a while.

#### The Accused’s communications with Stephen was corroborative of his intention to traffic in the drugs

170    The Accused had acknowledged in Court that, in relation to his previous drug transactions, in between calls to Praveen and the drug supplier, there were quite a few calls with his contact “Stephen”.[^249] The Prosecution’s Closing Submissions had set out in detail the communications between the Accused and Stephen, from 23 to 25 November 2015, in the lead up to the transaction on 26 November 2015.[^250] Most significantly, in the early morning of 26 November 2015, Stephen sent a message at 3.43am to the Accused stating “Is morning confirmed…?”.[^251] The Accused responded with “I’m on standby”, “Will update you”.[^252] As pointed out by the Prosecution, it was not disputed that the only significant event occurring that very morning was the planned delivery of drugs to the Accused’s shoe rack. It was also telling that the Accused received a number of missed calls from Stephen (together with those from Thenmolli, Praveen and the drug supplier) while he was asleep[^253], and after the Accused woke up the next morning, the first two persons he called (within a minute of each other) were Praveen and Stephen.[^254]

171    Based on the above, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the inference from these communications was that the Accused was waiting for the drug delivery and promised to update Stephen. This was suggestive of the Accused’s intention to further deal with the drugs he was expecting to receive that morning.[^255]

#### Accused disposed of the drugs because he spotted the CNB officers

172    In the Defence’s Closing Submissions, it was argued that the Accused had barely enough time (of about 2 minutes) between spotting the officers downstairs and being arrested, to dispose of the drugs which he had already brought into his flat. As such, it was submitted that he could not possibly have thrown the drugs only after looking out of the window.[^256]

173    However, the Accused’s version of retrieving and disposing of the drugs immediately after he ended the phone call with Praveen[^257], if believed, would have resulted in even less time for him to do so. The Accused’s call to Praveen at 12:21:32pm had lasted 53 seconds. He would therefore have ended this call at about 12:22:25pm, before making his next call to Stephen at 12:22:49pm.[^258] Thus, instead of having 2 minutes, the Accused would only have about 24 seconds to do the following:

> (a)     Get the key, unlock the gate, get out of his flat;

> (b)     Open all the doors of the shoe rack to look for the drugs;

> (c)     Go back into the flat with the drugs and enter his bedroom;

> (d)     Go to the kitchen and empty the bag into the dustbin; and

> (e)     Pick up his phone to check who else called him and return call to Stephen.

174    In my view, it was much more probable for the Accused to have disposed of the drugs within 2 minutes after he spotted the officers unloading house-raiding instruments below his flat, instead of within 24 seconds between making two phone calls. After all, the Accused conceded that he suspected that the officers were coming after him. This further reinforced the Prosecution’s case that the Accused disposed of the drugs in his possession after spotting the CNB officers, in an attempt to get rid of incriminating evidence, rather than to disrupt the transaction.[^259]

175    Therefore, having considered the full facts and circumstances of the case, including:

> (a)     the Accused’s participation with both Thenmolli and Praveen in previous drug trafficking transactions,

> (b)     the Accused’s involvement in engaging and paying for Praveen to act as courier, as well as liaising with the drug supplier for the present transaction, and

> (c)     Thenmolli facilitating the delivery on behalf of the Accused to its fruition,

I found that Accused did shared a common intention with Thenmolli in committing the offence.

## The Accused was convicted of the Trafficking Charge

176    In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven the Trafficking Charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found the Accused guilty and convict him of the same.

## The Accused pleaded guilty to the Consumption Charge

177    Subsequent to his conviction on the Trafficking Charge, the Accused pleaded guilty to the Consumption Charge (**DAC-901023-2017**):

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on or before the 24th day of November 2015, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act.

178    The Accused admitted to the following facts in relation to the Consumption Charge without qualification:

> **Facts relating to DAC-901023-2017- consumption of a Specified Drug under s 8(b)(ii) of Misuse of Drugs Act Cap 185**

> 4    Following his arrest, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples, which were marked as “C-SA-15-01795-1 YUAVARAJA S/O DEVAKUMAR SXXX” and “C-SA-15-01795-2 YUVARAJA S/O DEVAKUMAR SXXX”. These 2 bottles were later sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” respectively in his presence.

> 5    On 27 November 2015, the said urine samples were submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

> 6    The HSA subsequently issued two Certificates, under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), dated 30 November 2015 and 1 December 2015, bearing Lab No.: AT-1533-11265-001-03 and Lab No.: AT-1533-11265-002-03 respectively.

> 7    Zhang Huifen Hannah, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-15-01795-1 YUVARAJA S/O DEVAKUMAR SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing Lab No.: AT-1533-11265-001-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 8    Ong Han Hui Jordan, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-15-01795-2 YUVARAJA S/O DEVAKUMAR SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing Lab No.: AT-1533-11265-002-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 9    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 10    The accused admitted that he had consumed ‘ice’ which is a street name for methamphetamine before his arrest. He confessed that he had started abusing ‘ice’ sometime in 2009. After he was released from prison on 4 September 2015, the accused again continued to abuse ‘ice’ on a regular basis. The accused smoked ‘ice’ using an improvised bottle. He put the ‘Ice’ in the glass bulb that was attached to the bottle and then burned the bottom of the glass bulb. He then inhaled the smoke from the ‘ice’ from the other side of the bottle. The accused states that last time he smoked ‘ice’ was two days prior to his arrest in his house.

> 11    The accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine as the accused had consumed ‘ice’. The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume methamphetamine. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. The accused admits to the commission of the said offence and has been charged accordingly.

## Antecedents

## Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

180    The prescribed punishment for the Trafficking Charge was a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane to a maximum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life, and 15 strokes of the cane.

181    The prescribed punishment for the Consumption Charge was imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding $20,000 or both.[^260]

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

182    The Prosecution made oral submissions for a global sentence of at least 26 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution explained that they arrived at this global sentence by adopting the approach in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“_Raveen Balakrishnan_”).

183    With regard to the Trafficking Charge, the Prosecution highlighted that Thenmolli was sentenced to a term of 26 years’ imprisonment. Her appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. Thus, bearing in mind that the Accused was at least equally as culpable as Thenmolli, as well as the fact that Thenmolli had pleaded guilty and had a clean record, the Accused’s sentence for the Trafficking Charge should be more than 26 years.

184    As for the Consumption Charge, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing norm for a first-time offender was 8 months’ imprisonment for cases where accused persons pleaded guilty. The Prosecution submitted for the same sentence to be meted out to the Accused as the Accused had admitted to consuming methamphetamine habitually.

185    Next, based on the second step of the framework in _Raveen Balakrishnan_, the Prosecution submitted that the two sentences should run consecutively as the Trafficking and Consumption Charges were in respect of different legally protected interests. The Prosecution cited the case of _PP v Yusoff bin Abdul Hamid_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 322</span> as a precedent where the consecutive sentences for a drug trafficking charge and a drug possession charge (the Prosecution had mistakenly said that this was a drug consumption charge during their oral submissions) were upheld by the High Court on appeal. In our case, the Prosecution submitted that if both sentences were to run concurrently, the Accused would suffer the same punishment as Thenmolli, who not only did not face any consumption charge, but had even attempted to persuade the Accused to abstain from drug consumption.

186    The third step of the analysis set out in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ was for the sentence to be considered (and adjusted where necessary) in light of the totality principle. In this case, the Prosecution submitted that while the Accused ought to have received a higher sentence than the 26 years’ imprisonment for the Trafficking Charge that Thenmolli received, they were nonetheless of the view that the sentence should be calibrated down to 26 years. Thus, running the two terms of imprisonment consecutively, the total sentence would be 26 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

### Mitigation

187    The Defence tendered a written mitigation plea and submitted for the statutory minimum sentence (or a sentence close to it) to be imposed for the Trafficking Charge, and for the sentence for the Consumption Charge to run concurrently. The Defence was of the view that such a sentence was appropriate as the Accused had low culpability and was not the mastermind. His primary motive was to disrupt Thenmolli’s drug activities. This was also the Accused’s first drug conviction. As the Accused was also a victim of his family’s challenging circumstances, a custodial sentence of 20 years would be sufficiently deterrent.

188    In relation to the Trafficking Charge, the Defence highlighted the case of _Suventher Shanmugam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> (“_Suventher_”) where the Court of Appeal held that the indicative starting point for a first-time offender trafficking between 431 g to 500 g of cannabis should be 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. The Defence submitted that this starting point would have to be adjusted to reflect the accused person’s culpability and the presence of all aggravating and mitigating factors. Further, it must be noted that the starting point was not rigid or inflexible and the sentencing Judge might depart from it in an appropriate case. The sentence to be imposed should depend on the specific circumstances of each case. For the Trafficking Charge, the Defence submitted that the indicative starting point should be 26 years’ imprisonment.

189    As for the Consumption Charge, the Defence cited the case of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> where the High Court held that the range of imprisonment sentences for a first offender for drug consumption was between 6 to 18 months. As the Accused was a first-time offender, the Defence submitted that the indicative starting point should be 6 months’ imprisonment.

190    The Defence next submitted that the indicative starting sentences should be adjusted downwards due to the Accused’s low culpability in respect of both charges based on the following reasons:

> (a)     There was minimal planning or organisation on the Accused’s part in relation to the Trafficking Charge. He had used his own phone number to contact his associates, unlike Thenmolli who used multiple SIM cards or phones. Thus, this showed the Accused did little to plan or organise the operation and had simply followed the instructions of Thenmolli.

> (b)     The Accused did not pack or split the drugs. He participated in a number of phone calls and text messages while Thenmolli was the mastermind.

> (c)     The Accused was not a drug dealer who sought to actively sell or expand his drug network. The Prosecution was unable to show that the Accused had a clientele.

> (d)     The Accused was merely trying to disrupt Thenmolli’s activities and did not do more. The main actor with a client base was Thenmolli who sent messages instructing the Accused to collect money from her clients.

191    Further, the mitigating factors in this case outweighed the aggravating factors and the Accused’s sentence should be adjusted downwards:

> (a)     The Accused was a first time offender. Based on the case of _Fu Foo Tong v PP_ \[1995\] 1 SLR (R) 1, there should be a distinction in the sentences of offenders with antecedents and those without.

> (b)     The Accused was a victim of his circumstances. He came from a broken home with his father leaving the family when he was young and his mother having to work in a low-paying job to support the family. The Defence submitted that those of us who had never had to grow up in a poor and broken home would not be in a position to truly understand the pressures and circumstances that led a young child to turn to a life of crime. While the Defence was not saying that growing up poor without a father was a licence to commit crime, the Defence submitted that “we must be honest enough to acknowledge that the poorest and most broken in our society are disproportionately represented in prison”.

192    Based on the above, it was submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to a custodial term below that of the indicative starting position for the Trafficking Charge, and therefore a term of 20 years’ imprisonment would be commensurate with the Accused’s criminality and would accomplish both specific and general deterrence and prevention of crime. This was because the Accused would be in his mid-50s when he is released from prison and would not reoffend and risk having to spend the remaining of his life back in prison. Thus it was not necessary for the Court to sentence him to a longer period to achieve deterrence.

193    As for the Consumption Charge, it was submitted that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. Thus, overall, a global custodial sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane would be just in all the circumstances of the case.

194    In their oral submissions on sentence, the Defence added that the question was whether, the Accused, being young and healthy, and an asset to the country, should be put away for such a long time such that he would be of “no use” when he came out of prison. The Defence also urged the Court to consider, as an alternative, a sentence between that of Praveen’s and Thenmolli’s.

195    The Accused had also written a letter to address the Court in mitigation. In the letter, he mentioned that he understood that he was facing punishment for the wrong choices he had made in life. He felt sorry for causing his family so much pain. He promised that he would never make another wrong choice in life. The Accused highlighted that his daughters were 11 and 9 years old and he felt bad for breaking his promise to be there for them. The Accused also wanted to repay his mother for giving everything she had in life to him. The Accused said that he was remorseful for what he had done and asked the Court for leniency.

### Prosecution’s reply

196    In response, the Prosecution submitted that it would not be tenable for the Accused’s sentence to be between those meted out to Praveen and Themolli. The reason why Praveen was sentenced to only 20 years’ imprisonment, as mentioned in _PP v Thenmolli Devakumar_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 29</span> (“_Thenmolli Devakumar_”), was that he had extreme family hardship. His own mother was bedridden and the hospital bills were mounting. As such, he had trafficked drugs in part to pay for the medical bills. As for the Accused, he had a perfectly good job as a chef, and made a profit being a freelance tattoo artist. As such, there was no reason for him to resort to trafficking drugs. Also, the Accused was staying in his mother’s house so there was no pressing financial situation. In fact, if Thenmolli had not been sentenced to 26 years, the Prosecution would have been minded to submit for an even higher sentence against the Accused, given that the actual amount of drugs involved in this case was 731 grams of cannabis. However, as the Prosecution acknowledged that they were constrained by the principle of parity, they therefore submitted for the global sentence of 26 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

197    The Prosecution also disagreed that the Accused had never been involved in drugs. Instead, he had admitted that he had engaged and paid Praveen for 3 prior drug transactions.

### Sentencing considerations

198    In considering the appropriate sentence in this case, I agreed with both parties that the starting point for the Trafficking Charge was 26 years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution was also correct in pointing out that based on the actual amount of cannabis involved, but for the need to observe parity in sentencing, the starting point could well have been at the upper end of the range of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Suventher_.

199    In calibrating sentence, I found it helpful to refer to the sentencing decisions in _PP v Praveen s/o Prasath_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 133</span> (“_Praveen s/o Prasath_”) and _Thenmolli Devakumar._ I note that the latter was upheld on appeal by the High Court, while the prosecution had discontinued their appeal against sentence in the former.

200    Turning first to the decision in _Praveen s/o Prasath_, I noted that the Court in that case agreed with the prosecution that the starting indicative sentence would be in the range of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. However, the Court highlighted that Praveen was of a very youthful age of 19 years and was a first offender at the point of the commission of the drug trafficking offence. The Court also noted that Praveen did not show any anti-social pattern nor had any alcohol or drug problem. The Court was moved by Praveen’s plight, as he had to fend for himself and a bedridden mother since he was 13, and took on several jobs to make ends meet. In fact, Praveen had been doing so as the sole breadwinner without resorting to crime until he injured his hand. The Court found that the circumstances Praveen was facing could be considered to be exceptionally hard and crushing for many. As such, the Court was of the view that the mandatory sentence of 20 years would be sufficient punishment for Praveen.[^261]

201    In _Thenmolli Devakumar_, the Court drew a distinction between the roles played by Thenmolli and Praveen, noting the Thenmolli was more of a coordinator while Praveen’s role was limited to that of a courier. As such, Thenmolli was the more culpable offender and should be dealt with more severely.[^262] The Court proceeded to determine that the sentencing range for trafficking of 499.99 grams of cannabis was 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment.[^263] The Court studied the decision in _Praveen s/o Prasath_ in detail and turned to examine Thenmolli’s personal circumstances. The Court observed that Thenmolli, though coming from a humble background, did not possess exceptionally harsh circumstances such as Praveen’s when she committed the offence. There was nothing before the Court that she faced serious financial woes, or that she was a sole breadwinner or responsible for contributing to the family’s income for its upkeep. On the contrary, the Court noted that Thenmolli was benefiting from lodging provided by the Accused’s mother, while her aunt had volunteered to sponsor her studies at Temasek Polytechnic. The Court noted that the prosecution’s submission of 26 years’ imprisonment was already on the lower end of the relevant sentencing range, despite the indicative starting point of close to 29 years’ in view of the quantity of cannabis involved.

202    In the present case, I was of the view that the Accused’s role and culpability could not be said to be any lesser than that of Thenmolli’s. I had found, as a fact, that the Accused had actively facilitated the transaction in the Trafficking Charge by liaising with the drug supplier and paying Praveen to act as the courier for the transaction. On the morning of the offence, it was also the Accused who called to ensure that Praveen was awake. Based on the evidence before the Court, I had also found that the Accused fell asleep thereafter and therefore, Thenmolli assisted by taking over liaison with Praveen and the drug supplier.

203    Further, as pointed out by the Prosecution, there was no indication of such dire family or personal circumstances at the time of offence to compel the Accused to commit the offence. In fact, while Thenmolli had pleaded guilty, the Accused had claimed trial to the Trafficking Charge. As such, he could not expect to be given any discount on sentence which was usually accorded to accused persons who pleaded guilty as a sign of their genuine remorse. As such, I would agree with the Prosecution that, looking at the Trafficking Charge alone, the Accused should be sentenced to more than 26 years’ imprisonment.

204    As for the Consumption Charge, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence would be 7 months’ imprisonment, as the Accused was a first-time drug offender.

205    However, as the two charges each related to different legally protected interests, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentences should run consecutively.

206    Finally, in applying the totality principle, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial sentence for the Trafficking Charge be pegged at 26 years. In my view, the global imprisonment term of 26 years and 7 months was appropriate and proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality. It was also not substantially above the normal level of the sentences for the Trafficking Charge and therefore not a crushing sentence.

## CONCLUSION

207    In view of the above, I sentenced the Accused to 26 years and 7 months’ imprisonment, and 15 strokes of the cane. The sentence was back-dated to take effect from the Accused’s first date of remand, 27 November 2015.
