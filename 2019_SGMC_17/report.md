\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9083/2019/01 \]

22 April 2019

### District Judge May Mesenas:

## Background

1       The accused claimed trial to three charges. The first charge is for an offence of taking part in a public assembly without a permit under section 16(2)(a) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed)(“POA”). The second charge is for an offence of failing to comply with a direction to move on, without reasonable excuse, under section 37 of the POA. The third charge is for refusing to answer a public servant’s questions in relation to investigations conducted into the first and second charges, under section 179 of the Penal Code Cap 224 (“PC”). For the avoidance of doubt, the accused consented to have the three charges be heard together in a joint trial.

2       At the end of the hearing, the accused was convicted on all the charges and sentenced as follows:

a)     First charge (section 16(2)(a) POA) – Fine $5,000 and in default of payment of the fine, to serve 9 weeks’ imprisonment;

b)     Second charge (section 37 POA) – 16 weeks’ imprisonment; and

c)     Third charge (section 179 PC) – 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

Both sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Accordingly, the aggregate sentence amounted to 26 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 and in default of payment of the fine, to serve 9 weeks’ imprisonment. The global sentence was backdated to the date which the accused was first remanded on 2 March 2019.

3       On 18 April 2019, the accused filed a notice of appeal and is currently serving sentence.

## Charges

4       The three charges below state as follows:

MAC 902514-2019 (First charge)

You are charged that you, on 28 February 2019, at about 5.03pm, outside the Raffles Place MRT Station, located at 5 Raffles Place, Singapore, did take part in a public assembly in respect of which no permit had been granted to you, to wit, by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of Minister K. Shanmugam, and Commissioner of Prisons Desmond Chin on one side, and demonstrating opposition to the actions of Senior Judge Chao Hick Tin on the reverse side of the same placard; and by displaying a placard demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Hong Kong government, with the Chinese characters “抗議香港政府在裝甲車陰謀中出賣中國主權!” on one side of the placard, which means “Protest against the Hong Kong government for betraying the sovereignty of China in the armoured vehicles conspiracy!” in English, and demonstrating opposition to the actions of the Prime Minister of Singapore, PM Lee Hsien Loong, by displaying the words “PM Lee: Resign over Singapore’s Watergate Scandal and Nepotism!” on the reverse side of the said placard;

and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 16(2)(2)(a) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed);

and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 5 April 2018, in State Court 12, vide MAC-901950-2018, convicted of an offence punishable under section 16(2)(a) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed), and sentenced to a fine of $5,000 (in default 49 days’ imprisonment), which conviction and punishment have not been set aside, and you are thereby liable for enhanced punishment under Section 16(3)(b) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed).

MAC 902516-2018 (Third charge)

You are charged that you, on 1 March 2019, at about 12.59am, inside cell 10-M of Regional lock-up located at 391 New Bridge Road, Singapore, being legally bound under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(“CPC”) to state the truth on the subject of your public assembly on 28 February 2019, to Assistant Superintendent of Police Chan Kheng Yong Aaron, in the exercise of the legal powers of the said Assistant Superintendent of Police Chan Kheng Yong Aaron, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 179 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## First Charge

5       Section 5 of the POA states that no public assembly may be held in a public place unless a permit has been granted by the Commission of the Police under section 7 of the said Act. The offence of taking part in a public assembly without a permit is provided for in section 16(2)(a), which reads:

(2)    Each person who takes part in a public assembly or public procession –

(a)    in respect of which no permit has been granted under section 7 or no such permit is in force, where such permit is required by this Act;

shall be guilty of an offence and shall, subject to subsection (3), be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000.

For repeat offenders found guilty under section 16(2)(a), the offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000.

6       Section 17(1) provides a defence:

17—(1)    In any proceedings for an offence under section 16(1)(a) or (2)(a), it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that he did not know, and neither suspected nor had any reason to suspect, that no permit had been granted under section 7 in respect of the assembly or procession or that no such permit is in force, as the case may be.

7       The term “public assembly” is defined in section 2 of the POA as follows:

“public assembly” means an **assembly held** or to be held **in a public place** or to which members of the public in general are invited, induced or permitted to attend; \[Emphasis added\]

The term “assembly” is defined in section 2 of the said Act as:

“assembly” means a gathering or meeting (whether or not comprising any lecture, talk, address, debate or discussion) of persons the purpose (or one of the purposes) of which is ---

**to demonstrate** support for or **opposition** to the **views or actions of any person**, group of persons or **any government**;

to publicise a cause or campaign; or

to mark or commemorate any event;

**and includes a demonstration by a person alone for any such purpose referred to in paragraph (a)**, (b), (c);” \[Emphasis added\]

The term “public place” means:

**Any place (open to the air or otherwise) to which members of the public have access as of right** or by virtue of express or implied permission, whether or not on payment of a fee, whether or not access to the place may be restricted at particular times or for particular purposes, and whether or not it is an “approved place” within the meaning of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (Cap. 257); or…\[Emphasis added\]

8       I agree with the prosecution’s submission at \[10\] that the offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA is one of strict liability. Such an interpretation has also been affirmed by the High Court in previous cases[^1], which appeals against conviction for similar offences have been dismissed. Further, this is also supported by the Explanatory Statement to the Public Order Bill, which states:

Where a public assembly or public procession in respect of which no permit has been granted… takes place, each person who organises \[or takes part in\] a public assembly… is guilty of an offence.

9       The prosecution thus has to establish the following two elements:

(i)     The accused has taken part in a public assembly; and

(ii)     No permit has been granted in respect of that assembly.

#### Was the accused taking part in a public assembly?

10     The following facts were not in dispute. The accused was standing outside the Raffles Place MRT station on 28 February 2019 at about 5.03pm, holding to two placards, namely, P3 and P4, and ‘making declarations concerning the subject matters of his protest’[^2]. The body-worn camera footage (P1) recorded by the arresting officer, Station Inspector Juherman bin Zaiton (PW1) confirms this as well.

11     In P3, the Chinese characters “抗議香港政府在裝甲車陰謀中出賣中國主權!” which mean ‘Protest against the Hong Kong government for betraying the sovereignty of China in the armoured vehicles conspiracy!’ were printed on one side. On the reverse side of the same placard were the English words “_PM Lee: Resign over Singapore’s Watergate Scandal and Nepotism!_”

12     In P4, the words “_Judge Chao Hick Tin = Evil_” were printed on one side. On the reverse side, the words displayed (if read from left to right) were “_Chin and Desmond mugam: K. Shan_” followed by the following two lines “_Resign Over Prisoner Abuse_”. The accused did not dispute that he was protesting against Desmond Chin, the Commission of Prisons and Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam.

13     There was no permit applied for by the accused in relation to his protest on 28 February 2019, which was confirmed by ASP Jassman Fun (PW5), a police officer, in charge of the Operations Branch (and having oversight over the Compliance Management Unit) of the Central Police Division, which processes permit applications for public assemblies to be held at the location in question. This was unchallenged by the accused.

14     In his defence, the accused claimed ‘police corruption’ as a basis for not applying for the permit. In his written closing submissions at \[3\], he stated that the licensing officer was ‘malicious’ and that ‘their integrity should be improved’. These were merely bare assertions. In light of this, it was clear that the accused did not invoke section 17 of the POA which are the valid defences available, namely, that he did not know, suspect, or have reason to suspect, that a permit had not been granted in respect of this protest.

15     PW5 had also given evidence that the accused had previously applied for a permit to conduct a public assembly outside the Istana in 2016, which was rejected. As pointed out by the prosecution, the accused was clearly aware that a permit was required to conduct a demonstration in a public place and yet, had deliberately proceeded with the protest on 28 February 2019 without applying for one, despite knowing that it was required.

16     Taking the definitions of “public assembly” and “assembly”, a demonstration against the actions of any person or any government, by a single person in a public place is a “public assembly” for purposes of the offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA to be made out. Given the contents of P3 and P4 above, it was clear that the accused was conducting a demonstration against specific persons named as stated above and the Hong Kong government. The location outside the Raffles Place MRT station is clearly a place to which members of the public have access. Further, in P1 and P2, the accused was seen shouting to passers-by that he was protesting against the PAP government, Justice Chao Hick Tin and PM Lee Hsien Loong.

17     In view of the foregoing, I was satisfied that the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was taking part in a public assembly in respect of which no permit had been applied or issued by the Commission of Police.

## Second charge

18     Section 36(1) of the POA provides as follows:

Subject to this section, a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant may give to a person or group of persons whose behaviour is of a kind mentioned in section 35 any direction in writing that is reasonable in the circumstances.

19     Section 35(1)(d) of the POA provides that a move-on direction may be given to a person if the said police officer reasonably suspects the person’s behaviour ---

……

(d)    shows that he is just about to commit an offence or has just committed or is committing an offence.

20     PW2 had testified that he was a Station Inspector and thus above the rank of sergeant at the material time. He gave evidence that he had received information that the accused intended to conduct a public assembly without a permit in the open space outside Raffles Place MRT Station on 28 February 2019 at about 5.00pm. When PW2 arrived at the scene, he saw the accused displaying two placards (P3 and P4) and shouting to attract the attention of members of the public. According to PW2, the accused was protesting for a few minutes before he and his partner, Inspector Siaw Kah Swe (PW4) approached the accused. PW2 was aware that the accused did not have the requisite permit at the time when he was shouting his protests and holding onto the said placards. PW2 proceeded to issue the accused with the direction to move on in writing (“move-on direction”-P5) as he suspected the accused of committing the offence of taking part in a public assembly without a permit.

#### Whether PW2 ‘gave’ the accused a move-on direction in writing

21     Section 36 of the POA requires the police officer to ‘give’ a direction to move on to the person in writing. As seen in P1, PW2 held P5 to the accused’s eye level and informed him of its contents, stating the terms of the direction as well as the consequences for non-compliance. He also showed the accused the map annexed to P5, which sets out the demarcated area which the accused was to leave, and not return to, for a period of 24 hours (see s/n 21 of P2). When the accused refused to take P5, PW2 then left it on the ground at the accused’s feet.

22     The issue is whether PW2 had ‘given’ the direction to move on to the accused despite the latter’s refusal to accept the same. Under section 45(1)(a)(i) of the POA, any requirement under the Act stating that a document be ‘given’ may be fulfilled by ‘delivering it to the individual personally’. I agree with the prosecution that ‘delivery’ of the document is not premised on _physical acceptance or receipt_ of the document being given[^3].

23     This reading also accords with a contextual interpretation of the provision, seeing as the other means of ‘giving’ documents listed in section 45(1)(a) of the POA similarly do not require that the intended recipient physically accept or receive the document.

24     Even if ‘deliver’ is construed as requiring physical receipt of the document, it is not the only means of fulfilling the requirement that a direction be ‘given’. Section 45(1) of the POA provides that the requirement that a document be ‘given’ under the POA “may be” fulfilled by the means specified therein. This indicates that Parliament did not intend for this list to be exhaustive. Other means of conveying the contents of a document to its intended recipient (e.g. reading out its contents; leaving a copy of the documents with the intended recipient) can thus suffice to satisfy the requirement that it is ‘given’.

25     Further, an interpretation of the word ‘give’ which does not require physical receipt accords with a purposive interpretation of the provisions empowering the police to issue a move-on direction in writing. During the Second Reading of the Public Order Bill, then Second Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam said “(s)uch powers \[to issue move-on directions\] would allow pre-emptive action to defuse a situation or disrupt the continuance of an illegal act.” The legislature could not have intended for an offender committing an illegal act should be able to frustrate the police’s efforts to defuse the situation or disrupt his offending simply by refusing to physically take a direction in writing from the issuing officer.

26     By virtue of section 48A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)(“IA”), it would appear that personal delivery of a document to an individual personally constitutes ‘giving’ the said document to him. For ease of reference, section 48(1) of the IA provides as follows:

Where a written law authorises or requires a document to be served on a person, whether the expression “serve”, “give” or “send” or any other expression is used, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the document may be served –

in the case of an individual ---

by delivering it to the individual personally;

by leaving it at, or by sending it by pre-paid post to, the usual or last known address of the place of residence or business of thee individual; \[..\]

27     Additionally, in the context of effective service of documents, the High Court has accepted that service can be validly effected even if the person being served refuses to accept the document as long as the server “_informed the person to be served of the nature of the document and throws it down in his presence_” (see _Maruti Shipping Pte Ltd v Tay Sien Djim_ at \[56\]).

28     Based on the evidence adduced from PW2, which was unchallenged by the defence, I was satisfied that the accused was given the written direction to move on by PW2, within the meaning of section 36 of the POA.

#### Was the move-on direction reasonably necessary in the interests set out in section 36(2) of the POA?

29     Section 36(2) of the POA states as follows:

(2)    A police officer shall not give a direction under subsection (1) that interferes with a person’s right of peaceful assembly unless it is reasonably necessary in the interests of ---

(a)    public safety;

(b)    public order;

(c)    the protection of the rights and freedom of other persons.

Section 36(3) further provides:

(3)    The rights and freedoms referred to in subsection (2)(c) includes a reference to the rights and freedoms of the public to enjoy the place and the rights of persons to carry on lawful business in or in accordance with the place.

30     PW2 had testified that a crowd of about 30 to 40 people had gathered to watch the accused. This can also be seen in P1. Based on PW2’s testimony, there was a risk of a ‘public order incident’ if the accused managed to rile the crowd’s emotions with the messages on his placards. He further added that there were public safety concerns as public disorder would present a risk of injury to the persons in the crowd if the onlookers present at the scene turned ‘rowdy’[^4]. Additionally, he also stated that the crowd gathered as a result of the accused’s public protest, would also have obstructed other members of the public who sought to move around the area.

31     In view of the foregoing, I agree that the direction to move on was reasonably necessary for public safety, public order as well as for the protection of the right of members of the public to move around the area.

#### Were the conditions in the direction reasonable?

32     The direction to move on required the accused to leave the area demarcated in the map (annexed to P5) and not return for the duration of 24 hours from 5.06pm, 28 February 2019.

33     PW2 testified that the accused was asked to leave the demarcated area for the specified duration so as to give him time to cool off and reconsider his offending conduct, as well as to prevent him from simply coming back to stage another protest within a short period[^5].

34     I agree with the prosecution that these conditions were reasonable in the circumstances given that the accused had already committed an offence by staging a public protest without a permit under section 16(2)(a) of the POA and the risks that his behaviour posed to public safety, public order and the right of free movement of the public around that area.

#### Did the accused fail to comply with the move-on direction without any reasonable excuse?

35     On the evidence adduced from PW2 and PW4, as well as P2, it was clear that even after the move-on direction (P5) was given to the accused, PW2 and PW4 gave the accused two opportunities to comply with the direction by informing him of the consequences for non-compliance. They had even given him time and space to consider complying with the direction. However, the accused chose to remain where he was and continued to ‘brandish the placards’[^6], shouting that he ‘will not leave this area’, telling PW2 and PW4 that he was ‘not interested in any final warning’ and for them to ‘go away’ and even challenged them to arrest him (see P2). The facts above remain unchallenged by the defence.

36     The issue is whether the accused had a ‘reasonable excuse’ to contravene the move-on direction which he has to prove on a balance of probabilities. In his defence, the accused offered two excuses: first, that the move-on direction was unnecessary and the police should have arrested him immediately to stop him from protesting if they considered the protest unlawful; second, the police were fully aware that he would not comply with the move-on direction, but ‘maliciously’ issued the direction regardless.

37     These excuses proffered by the accused were clearly not reasonable. The police did not effect arrest immediately after the accused began his public protest as they had wanted to give him both ample time and space to ‘cool off’ and consider complying with the move-on direction. This was consistent with the demarcated area being set a certain distance away from the vicinity where the accused was staging his protest[^7]. As the evidence remain unchallenged by the defence, and given the accused’s failure to provide reasonable excuses for non-compliance of move-on direction, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved the charge under section 37 of the POA beyond reasonable doubt.

## Third charge

38     Section 179 PC reads as follows:

Whoever, being legally bound to state the truth on any subject to any public servant, refuses to answer any questions demanded of him touching that subject by such public servant, in the exercise of the legal powers of such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine which may extend to $3,000, or with both.

39     The elements of the offence are as follows:

(a)     there was a question posed by a public servant to the accused;

(b)     the accused was legally bound to state the truth on any subject to the public servant;

(c)     the answer to the question was required by the public servant in the exercise of his legal powers; and

(d)     the accused refused to answer the question demanded of him on that subject.

40     On the undisputed facts, ASP Aaron Chan (PW6), a police officer, is a ‘public servant’ by virtue of section 22(1)(g) of the PC, which states that a ‘public servant’ includes:

(g)    every officer of Government whose duty it is, as such officer, to prevent offences, to give information of offences, to bring offenders to justice, or to protect the public health, safety or convenience;

41     Section 22(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) provides that a police officer acting in the course of his duty, in conducting investigations under Part IV of the CPC, may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with any facts and circumstances of the case.

42     Section 22(2) of the CPC further states:

(2)    The person examined shall be bound to state truly what he knows of the facts and circumstances of the case, except that he need not say anything that might expose him to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture.

43     It was further undisputed that PW6, was the investigating officer, assigned to conduct investigations pertaining to the accused for a suspected offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA, committed on 28 February 2019. He was thus lawfully empowered to exercise his powers of examination under section 22 of the CPC, to question the accused regarding the facts and circumstances of the case. In that regard, PW6 posed questions to the accused which was recorded in P10.

#### Was the accused legally bound to state the truth to PW6 on the facts and circumstances concerning events on 28 February 2019?

44     The issue is whether the accused was legally bound to state the truth to PW6 when he is questioned about the facts and circumstances of the case. The prosecution contended that persons examined by police officers under section 22 of the CPC are bound to state truly what they know about the case, save that they need not say anything which ‘might expose \[them\] to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture.’[^8]

45     Further, the prosecution relied on the Indian Supreme Court decision in _Nandini Satpathy v PL Dani_ (1978) CrLJ 968 (“_Nandini Sathpathy_”), where an accused person who refused to answer questions put to her by a police officer under a provision substantially similar to section 22(2) of the CPC could incur criminal liability under section 179 of the Indian Penal Code, which is in _pari materia_ with section 179 of the PC. The Court held at \[60\] that the proviso excluding the person being examined from having to answer questions with answers ‘which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture’ only excuses the person being examined from having to give answers with a “reasonable, real, material or probable” likelihood of incriminating himself. The Court further elaborated at \[70\] as follows that[^9]:

…fanciful claims, unreasonable apprehensions and vague possibilities cannot be the hiding ground for an accused person. He is bound to answer where there is no clear tendency to incriminate.

46     I now set out the list of questions posed to the accused as per P10 for ease of reference:

47     The accused’s defence is that he had provided some answers like his name, address and mobile phone to either other police officers or to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”) on earlier occasions (prior to the recording of P10). He had in fact alluded that he had informed police officers who arrested him on 23 February 2019 of his updated residential address. As such, he did not see any reason why he had to answer PW6’s ‘silly questions’. Whilst the accused did not specifically cross-examine PW6 to suggest that the questions posed to him in P10 would result in incriminating answers being furnished, the defence contended in his closing submissions at \[5\] that all the questions posed would lead him to incriminate himself to the first and second charges and ‘all other questions’ which had ‘no connection with the elements of the charges would be unnecessary’. He further submitted that PW6 had ‘misused his power’ and given his history of having protested in a public place on eight previous occasions and the fact that ‘the protest was recorded’, there was no reason for PW6 to ask ‘silly questions’. He further added that PW6 had asked such questions in an attempt to ‘boost his own competence’.

#### Did the accused refuse to answer a public servant authorised to question?

48     Having examined the series of questions, I was of the view that not all the answers to the questions posed by PW6 would be incriminatory or had a clear tendency to incriminate, or expose him to a ‘criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture’, should the accused state the truth therein as required under section 22(2) of the CPC. I agree with the prosecution that question 1 was a very general question dealing with the accused’s knowledge of the facts of the case. There was nothing to suggest that the accused had to give details which may incriminate him. As for question 4, it was a factual inquiry into the meaning the Chinese characters in one of the placards. Question 9 could hardly be characterised as incriminatory as it pertains to the accused’s personal particulars. As for question 10, the prosecution submitted that ‘it merely sought to determine if the accused recognised the move-on direction which had been issued to him[^10]’. I did not agree with the prosecution that the answer to this question would necessarily not incriminate him if he were to state the truth.

49     That said, I agree with the prosecution that the accused was under a legal obligation to answer the questions posed by PW6 (whether the accused subjectively believes them to be ‘silly’ or not) at the material time he was being lawfully examined by PW6 as long as his answers could not have incriminated him in any way[^11].

50     Additionally, I found the accused’s refusal to answer questions 1, 4 and 9 was clearly blatant in light of the fact that he had at the very outset did not wish to co-operate with the authorities, by first refusing to leave the cell for an interview (P9)[^12] and subsequently stating that he was exercising his right of silence even before PW6 started posing the questions as stated in P10. His conduct was not a case of exercising his right to not self-incriminate to questions posed by PW6 in the course of recording P10. The accused had made it abundantly clear to PW6 and his colleagues that he was not going to answer any of the questions regardless of the nature of the questions. He was in fact lying to his left in a foetal position with the blanket covering his body and legs when PW6 tried to engage him.[^13] He continued to remain uncooperative even after PW6 had expressly warned him that his refusal to provide a statement may amount to an offence.

51     In light of the foregoing, I was thus satisfied that all four elements as stated in \[36\] above have been proven beyond reasonable doubt.

## Defence’s request to summon defence witnesses

52     For completeness, the accused sought a court order to summon the Attorney-General as well as his landlord as defence witnesses. His reason for doing so was for the former to give evidence regarding his recent complaint he had made in a letter to the AGC regarding the ‘corrupt’ police officers and its outcome. According to the accused, AGC had since replied stating that it was ‘receiving attention’. In relation to the landlord’s evidence, the accused asserted that the landlord was ‘a subordinate of an intelligence officer’ who was ‘spying’ on him on behalf of the PAP government, which in turn resulted in his arrest for the current offences.

53     I rejected the accused’s application for the court to summon these witnesses as I fail to see how these witnesses would have been able to advance the defence’s case, especially when the AGC was prosecuting the accused for the present offences. I found it also inexplicable that the landlord would have been responsible for the arrest of his current offences, particularly, when the accused had already sent an email to the PM, various governmental agencies and the media (P7), that he was about to stage a protest at the Raffles Place MRT station at the material time.

54     For the reasons stated above, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved all three charges beyond a reasonable doubt and as such the accused was found guilty and convicted on all the three charges.

The appeals against conviction and sentence for all of the above previous convictions were dismissed by the High Court.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

56     The prosecution submitted that deterrence and prevention are the dominant sentencing considerations for the present case. In particular, there was a need to specifically deter the accused from his repeated offending behaviour as well as prevention for the protection of the public where the offender must be physically incapacitated and removed from general public society because the members of the general public need to be protected from his criminal conduct. It was further submitted that persistence in offending, particularly, must be met by sentences that achieve the need for prevention[^14].

57     The offences under section 37 of the POA and section 179 of the PC call for sentences that significantly emphasise the need for general deterrence whereas specific deterrence and prevention would be particularly applicable for the offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA in view of his numerous previous convictions for the same offence. The following relevant factors were highlighted in relation to each specific offence as set out in prosecution’s address on sentence at \[21\] – \[24\] below:

21    The factors justifying the need for specific deterrence and protection of the public with respect to the offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA are:

·    the serious nature of the protests;

·    the long string of similar antecedents; and

·    the clearly premeditated conduct.

22    The factors justifying the need for general and specific deterrence, with respect to the offence under section 37 of the POA are:

·    the accused had no explanation for not complying with the move-on direction;

·    the accused disobeyed the move-on direction entirely;

·    the effect of non-compliance with the move-on direction was the continued commission of a criminal offence;

·    the presence of the public; and

·    the public disquiet caused.

23    The factors justifying the need for general deterrence, with respect to the offence under section 179 PC are:

·    the accused had no legal grounds to refuse to answer questions lawfully posed to him by a police officer;

·    the accused, in wilful defiance of lawful authority, prevented a police officer from discharging his public duty; and

·    public interest lies in ensuring the ability of police officers to investigate crimes and gather evidence, including through taking statements from suspects, is not frustrated.

24    Finally, the aggravating factors that cut across all offences are:

·    the total absence of remorse;

·    the accused having re-offended very soon after release from imprisonment;

·    there being no impediment to his ability to understand the nature and consequences of his actions;

·    the high risk of re-offending; and

·    his having claimed trial with no valid defence.

58     Thus, for the offence under section 16(2)(a) of the POA, the prosecution submitted for the maximum fine of $5,000, which is the maximum punishment prescribed. This was given the fact that the previous sentence of the maximum fine imposed for the last few convictions for the same offence had failed to deter the accused. Furthermore, the increasing longer imprisonment terms imposed in default of payment of the maximum fine for each previous conviction, has also not deterred the accused from re-offending. In fact, the previous default imprisonment term of 7 weeks’ imposed on 5 April 2018, had failed to deter the accused as upon his release from prison on 20 September 2018 (after serving the global sentence imposed by two different courts including the default imprisonment term of 7 weeks), he re-offended shortly thereafter on 28 February 2019. He had in fact made it blatantly clear that he would continue to re-offend and had asked PW2 (during cross-examination) if the police would continue to issue him with a move-on direction when he held his next unlawful public assembly in future. In that regard, a default term of not less than 10 weeks’ imprisonment was sought.

59     A sentencing framework based on the harm-culpability matrix for the offence under section 37 of the POA was submitted, given that it was previously accepted by the district judge who dealt with a similar offence[^15]. The harm-culpability matrix is reproduced below:

![]([2019] SGMC 0017_Image/[2019] SGMC 0017_image1.png)

60     Based on the above matrix, the prosecution contended that based on the offence-specific factors, the accused is of “Low-to-Medium” culpability. The “Low-to-Medium” culpability was derived from taking into account the fact that the accused had no reason to not comply with the direction, had completely ignored the direction despite having been told of the consequences for non-compliance and continued with the underlying criminal conduct (i.e taking part in an unlawful public assembly). Moreover, the law does not require the police to inform the accused of the consequences of non-compliance more than once. The accused was in fact given two opportunities to comply but he failed to do so.

61     As for the degree of harm, the prosecution argued that the effect of non-compliance of the direction resulted in the continued commission of the criminal offence for the present case. Move-on powers were essentially given to police officers as a means of preventing crime and maintaining public order and safety. Further, the flouting of the direction took place in full view of other members of the public, creating a real risk that members of the crowd may even cross over and join in the public disorder that was occurring. Further, such blatant disregard would also have an impact on public confidence in the ability of police officers to carry out their duties. Thus, it was submitted that in view of the foregoing, the harm occasioned ought to be categorised as ‘moderate’.

62     In that regard, given the “Low-to-Medium” culpability and “Moderate Harm” as suggested by the prosecution, it was further submitted that the approriate indicative sentencing range would be 1 to 4 months’ imprisonment. Given the relevant facts and circumstances, a 3-month imprisonment term would be an appropriate starting point. Additionally, in view of the the accused’s lack of remorse in stating repeatedly that he had no intention to comply with the move-on direction issued to him for the present case or in the future, when he decides to carry on holding unlawful public assemblies, as well as his previous similar conviction for which a 10-week imprisonment term had failed to deter him from re-offending, the prosecution suggested that the adjusted starting point would be a sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment, subject to a further adjustment based on the totality principle.

63     As for the offence under section 179 of the PC, the prosecution submitted that a custodial sentence was the starting point given that the actual harm lay in the obstruction of lawful exercise of police power and that there was a need to deter those who wilfully seek to obstruct the lawful exercise of police powers. As such, the harm caused was sufficiently serious.

64     The prosecution submitted that the accused’s culpability was high in view of the fact that the accused had deliberately refused to answer a single question posed to him by PW6 and expresed his refusal to answer in a particularly contemptous fashion, first, by refusing to proceed to the interview room to be interviewed, and second, by remaining in his cell and choosing to lie down in a foetal position with his feet facting the cell gates when PW6 attempted to engage him.

65     The prosecution further argued that the accused’s refusal to answer was deeply grounded in narcissim and not any genuine belief in the right against self-incrimination. He had stated in his closing submissions that ‘all other questions in no connection with the elements of the charges would be unncessary’ and had even went so far as to label PW6’s questions as ‘silly’ as PW6 wanted to ‘boost his own competence’. The contempt displayed by the accused against lawful authority continued even after PW6 informed the accused that his refusal to answer questions when required under section 22 of the CPC may constitute an offence. Such conduct was described by the prosecution as “obstinate obstructionism” where the accused had deliberately and in a premeditated manner chosen not to co-operate in any way with the police investigations.

66     It was submitted that the accused was clearly lacking in remorse in claiming trial despite not having any defence to advance, where he did not dispute any of the facts relevant to the charge. Instead, he continued to use the court as a platform to ventilate his indignation towards the police and the legal system, calling the police ‘corrupt’ and the court ‘biased’ on more than one occasion. Furthermore, despite having been previously sentenced to 8 weeks’ imprisonment for a similar offence, the accused remains undeterred and continues to show a wilful lack of any recognition of lawful authority. In light of the above, the prosecution sought a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

67     Additionally, the prosecution sought for both imprisonment terms to run consecutively as the public interests underlying the offences under section 37 of the POA and section 179 of the PC are different. Thus, in line with the totality principle and given the fact that the accused is a persistent offender, coupled with a pressing public interest concern in discouraging the accused’s targeting his disorderly behaviour at police officers, and his wilful flouting of lawful directions by the police, it was submitted that the aggregate sentence of 28 weeks’ imprisonment and the maximum fine of $5,000 with an in-default term of 10 weeks’ imprisonment, was appropriate. As the aggregate sentence of 28 weeks’ imprisonment is about 38% of the cumulative maximum sentence for the two offences under sections 37 POA and 179 PC (i.e. 18 months’ imprisonment), it was further submitted that this could not be viewed as crushing.

## Mitigation

68     The accused did not attempt to submit on anything that was mitigating in nature. Instead, the accused stated that the prosecution ought to be asking for the maximum sentences if it would deter him from re-offending in future, consistent with deterrence and prevention as the sentencing considerations to be applicable. He submitted for the maximum sentences for both the offences under sections 37 of the POA and 179 of the PC to be imposed, making it a total of 18 months’ imprisonment. He further asserted that there was no justice and that he would continue with his protests in future.

## Sentence

#### Punishment prescribed

69     The punishments prescribed for the following offences are:

(a)     Section 16(2)(a) of the POA which is punishable under section 16(3)(b) POA for a repeat offender – maximum fine of $5,000;

(b)     Section 37 of the POA - fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both.

(c)     Section 179 of the PC – imprisonment term of up to 6 months or a fine of up to $3,000 or both.

#### Sentencing considerations

70     I agree largely with what the prosecution has highlighted as the relevant sentencing considerations and factors in determining the appropriate sentence.

71     First and foremost, there was no real dispute in facts for all three charges either. Second, there was nothing of real mitigating value which was advanced by the accused, that this court was able to consider. Instead, the accused had even threatened to continue with his public protests upon his release from prisons. His continued allegations and rantings of corruption of the entire legal system and malicious prosecution by the police officers, were his only defence, which were merely bare assertions, not rooted in fact or proof of the same. With the evident lack of remorse, and the fact that he is a recalcitrant offender for similar offences, the need for specific deterrence and prevention would plainly be the key sentencing considerations at play here. Given the nature of the offences committed, general deterrence would be relevant to ensure that like-minded persons who choose to cause great disturbance and disquiet in public places as well as to wilfully obstruct the lawful exercise of police powers, will be met with stiff sentences.

72     Despite the multiple incarcerations, the accused remains undeterred. The accused is not new to the current offences for which he has been previously convicted and for which the sentences to be meted out would now have to be calibrated upwards to meet the sentencing objectives as highlighted above.

#### Appropriate sentence

### Section 16(2)(a) of the POA

73     As this offence only carries a maximum fine of $5,000, I agree with the prosecution that the default sentence to be imposed would have to be increased accordingly as each increment in the length of the default imprisonment term for the past similar convictions, have failed to deter the accused. In that regard, I was of the view that the maximum fine would have to be imposed given his last conviction also attracted a similar sentence.

74     I was of the view that an increase from the default imprisonment term imposed for the last similar conviction on 5 April 2018, would be necessary as the last default term of 7 weeks’ imprisonment did not deter him from re-offending. Further, given that the accused is unlikely to pay the fine (which he has not done so for all past convictions for this similar offence), and that this default sentence would have to run consecutively to the imprisonment terms imposed for the remaining offences, I was of the view that a 9-week imprisonment in default of the accused paying the fine, would suffice.

### Section 37 of the POA

75     Taking into account the culpability-harm matrix suggested by the prosecution, I agree with the analysis put forth for which the sentence of 3 months would be the indicative starting point. Given that the last sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the same offence did not sufficiently deter the accused, and taking into account the fact that the accused re-offended on 28 February 2019, barely five months after he was released on 20 September 2018, as well as the aggravating factors highlighted above, I was of the view that the sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

### Section 179 of the PC

76     Whilst the accused has a right against self-incrimination, it does not however, entitle him to wilfully refuse to answer every single question posed by PW6, who was lawfully exercising his police powers as the investigating officer for the current case. In determining the appropriate sentence for this charge, I gave due weight to the accused’s obvious belligerence when he refused to even proceed to the interview room and instead chose to lie down in a foetal position with his feet facing the cell gates, in clear defiance towards PW6, that he was not going to co-operate, regardless of the nature of the questions to be posed. This was despite being warned by PW6 that his failure to give a statement would amount to an offence.

77     The previous sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment for the current offence had failed to deter him and in that regard, an increase in the length of the sentence was warranted. I determined that a 10-week imprisonment term would suffice, bearing in mind that the maximum prescribed punishment is 6 months’ imprisonment.

#### Overall sentence

78     I agree with the prosecution that both sentences under sections 37 of the POA and 179 of the PC ought to run consecutively as they clearly deal with different interests. Bearing in mind the totality and proportionality principles, I was of the view that the overall sentence should not be overly crushing, and determined that the aggregate sentence of 26 week’s imprisonment was justified in the circumstances. This was also noting the fact that the accused had previously been sentenced to a global sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment for similar offences on 5 April 2018 and 7 May 2018 respectively (see \[52\] above).

79     In the event that the accused fails to pay the fine imposed, a further 9 weeks’ imprisonment would have to be served in default, making it a total of 35 weeks’ imprisonment, which is by no stretch of the imagination manifestly excessive in the circumstances. This is also notwithstanding the accused’s bizarre and inexplicable submission for the maximum 18 months’ to be imposed[^16]. The sentence was further ordered to be backdated to the accused’s first date of remand.

_The accused was convicted and sentenced to twenty-six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 and nine weeks’ imprisonment in default of payment of the fine._
