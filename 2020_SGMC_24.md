Debt & Recovery – Acknowledgement of account – Loan or gift – Character of monies extended

Debt & Recovery – Unpaid salary – Claim lodged at TADM – Effect of Withdrawal Form

29 April 2020

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## INTRODUCTION[^1]

1       This is the Plaintiff’s claim for monies he allegedly lent to the Defendant. The Defendant, in turn, counterclaimed against the Plaintiff, also for a loan.

2       The Plaintiff’s original claim against the Defendant was for an amount of S$11,207.10 which is constituted as follows:

> (a)     S$1,000 for purchases from Taobao (an online shopping website);

> (b)     S$1,000 loan made on 16 September 2016;

> (c)     S$7,500 loan made on 11 November 2016 to settle maid injury issue;

> (d)     S$836.70 for the dental treatment on 7 March 2017; and

> (e)     S$870.40 for the booking of a resort on 5 February 2017

(to be referred to, collectively as “**Loans**”).

3       As the Defendant subsequently admitted to claim items (b), (c) and (e), the only claim items in contention are items (a) and (d).

4       The Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff is for S$28,000. This amount is allegedly 7 months’ salary at the rate of S$4,000 per month which the Plaintiff, as the Defendant’s employer, should have paid the Defendant, but which was retained by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was a shareholder and managing director of the companies that the Defendant worked in during the relevant period.

## FACTS OF THE CASE

## The Background

5       The Plaintiff and Defendant became friends in the middle of 2016 when they were introduced to each other by one Ms Rokiah Bte Ab Manan (“**DW1**”). According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff became a close friend and a family friend and would often buy gifts for her and her family.[^2]

6       Subsequently, the Defendant also started working in the Plaintiff’s companies, Uni-Port Services Pte. Ltd. (“**Uni-Port**”) and Sibre Brakes (S.E.A.) Pte. Ltd. (“**Sibre Brakes**”). The Defendant started working in Uni-Port in early February 2017,[^3] and in Sibre Brakes on 1 March 2017.[^4] (Her employment with Sibre Brakes ceased on 27 October 2017.[^5])

## The Counter-claim

7       It is the Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff that salary which was due to her by Sibre Brakes for March 2017 to October 2017 was not paid. She alleged that the Plaintiff, as the managing director of Sibre Brakes, took a loan from her by way of Sibre Brakes’ retaining her salary. She further alleged that he had requested for it as he was then going through a divorce and required the funds.[^6] The outstanding salary amounted to S$28,000 (after CPF deductions). The Defendant had considered this a personal loan to the Plaintiff.

8       It is also not disputed that the Defendant had filed a claim against Sibre Brakes at the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (“**TADM**”) in December 2017 for “non/short payment of salary” for 1 March 2017 to 27 October 2017.[^7] On 28 December 2017, the Plaintiff received an email from the TADM Mediator that the Defendant had received payment for her claim.[^8] A Withdrawal Form was attached to the said email.[^9]

## The Claim

9       Regarding the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant, it is the Plaintiff’s case that during the period on or around 14 August 2016 to 5 February 2017,[^10] the Plaintiff extended monies to the Defendant which the Plaintiff is alleging are loans. These are the Loans. However, the Defendant had argued that the loans of S$1,000 were gifts, or that the S$7,500 was a loan which was not yet due and payable, or the dental treatment charged to the Plaintiff’s credit card was a company benefit.

10     Of particular interest in the present case are the S$1,000 expended for the Taobao purchases and the S$836.70 for the dental treatment.

#### The S$1,000 Taobao Purchases

11     It is not in dispute that the S$1,000 online purchases from Taobao were for household items, and that they were for the Defendant’s home. The Defendant admitted that the Plaintiff did make purchases for her in 2016. However, when she had tried to repay him, “he \[had\] refused the payment and said the purchases were a gift for all I had done for him.”[^11]

#### The S$836.70 Cost of Dental Treatment

12     As for the amount of S$836.70 for dental treatment, it is not in dispute that the Plaintiff charged the dental expense to his credit card. However, it was the Defendant’s understanding that because the Plaintiff was the director of her employer, Sibre Brakes, the company was bearing the cost of the treatment. She further believed that the Plaintiff had claimed reimbursement from Sibre Brakes.

13     It is also not in dispute that the Plaintiff had, on a few occasions, raised to the Defendant the amounts that were repayable to him but which communications had not resulted in any repayment. These communications included –

> (a)     the Plaintiff’s email to the Defendant dated 30 December 2017, enclosed with an IOU document for the Defendant to confirm and acknowledge;[^12] and

> (b)     a letter of demand dated 3 August 2018 from the Plaintiff’s previous lawyers to the Defendant listing the five claim items.

## ISSUES & THE GENERAL LAW

14     This case raises questions of fact. They are:

> (a)     Whether the S$1,000 Taobao purchase was a loan or gift to the Defendant;

> (b)     Whether the S$836.70 dental expense was repayable to the Plaintiff by the Defendant or the Defendant’s understanding that it would be reimbursed by Sibre Brakes was correct; and

> (c)     Whether the Plaintiff owes the Defendant S$28,000 being a loan from Defendant’s salary.

15     The burden of proof is on the Plaintiff and the Defendant to prove their respective case on a balance of probabilities.

16     On the Plaintiff’s claim, I would like to state that there is no dispute that there are such incidences of monies extended to the Defendant. The issue is only with regard to whether they are repayable to the Plaintiff by the Defendant. In this case, it would not be repayable if it was a gift or if it was to be claimed from the Defendant’s employer instead.

17     If this Court finds that the amounts extended to the Defendant was a loan as claimed, then, by the case of _Gobind Lalwani_ v _Basco Enterprises Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 424</span>, it would be an “account stated” since the Defendant is not disputing that she did have the benefit of such an amount extended to her.

18     It then follows that, by _Gobind Lalwani_’s case, unless there is evidence of any special contractual arrangement such as for “deferring payment or an agreement for other methods of payment”[^13], “a creditor is entitled to demand payment at any time by giving reasonable notice. Indeed, in law if there is no stipulation as to the time for repayment, the liability to pay arises without the need for making any request or demand: see _Norton_ v _Ellam_ (1837) 2 M & W 461 at 464; 150 ER 839 at 840 and _In re George_; _Francis_ v _Bruce_ (1890) 44 Ch D 627.”[^14] In this case, there is no special contractual arrangement made for any deferment of payment or any particular method of payment. By the Plaintiff’s earlier said email and letter of demand made to the Defendant, any requirement of reasonable notice would also have been satisfied.

19     So, if the Court finds the monies extended to the Defendant for the Taobao purchases and the dental expenses to be loans, the liability to pay would therefore arise. I am stating these only for completeness as these were not issues raised before me.

20     The claims in this case therefore turn very much on the facts.

## ISSUE 1: THE S$1,000 TAOBAO PURCHASES – LOAN OR GIFT?

## The Plaintiff’s Case

21     It is the Plaintiff’s case that the S$1,000 purchases on Taobao were never a gift to the Defendant, but was always a loan. On or about 14 August 2016, the Plaintiff and Defendant would surf the website and they would discuss before the Plaintiff made the purchase. It is the Plaintiff’s case that “it’s a both party agreement”[^15] on what to purchase. The Plaintiff continued:[^16]

> Of course, I cannot buy something that she---she didn’t like and she di---didn’t want. It’s all the item---it show in the list. I show her bef---im---some---some of the time, we show on the phone and she---she wants it, then we will go ahead with the purchase.

22     Even when it was attributed to the Plaintiff as the one who converted the Defendant’s house into modern style, the Plaintiff had maintained that it was by “mutual agreement”.[^17]

23     For the record, the relevant purchases for this claim made and paid with the Plaintiff’s credit card came up to an amount of S$1,011.22.[^18] However, the Plaintiff was contented to just claim S$1,000 from the Defendant. In an email of 14 August 2016 to the Defendant, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant, “I will absorb the shipment cost as consider you a family member on tumpang.”[^19] The same email also stated: “Just transfer the fund to my DBS Bank”, and then the name on the account and the account number were provided to the Defendant.

## The Defendant’s Case

24     The Defendant argued that during that period, the Plaintiff was going through a very bad divorce. This was admitted by the Plaintiff when he said, “I’m experience a very, very bad experience from my divorce case”.[^20] He added that “at that time, I’m going to commit suicide”.[^21] There is therefore no denying that the Defendant being present at that time, had “help\[ed\] \[the Plaintiff\] and salvage\[d\] \[his\] life”,[^22] like what he declared to DW1, their mutual friend, in late December 2017 or mid January 2018. When he was cross-examined, the Plaintiff also agreed with Defendant’s Counsel that he was very grateful to the Defendant for what she did for him.[^23]

25     It was therefore the Defendant’s case that because of the relationship the Plaintiff had with the Defendant, when the Defendant tried to repay the Plaintiff around the eve of Chinese New Year 2017 for the Taobao purchases, the Plaintiff had told her that it was a gift.[^24] The Plaintiff denies that he ever told the Defendant that. But Defendant’s Counsel would like the Court to believe that the Defendant’s assertions are more likely to be true than not.[^25]

26     The Defendant also argued that apart from the 14 August 2016 email[^26] which made reference to repayment, the Plaintiff did not pursue the alleged debt until 27 October 2017 when the Defendant’s employment with the Plaintiff’s companies were terminated. If the Plaintiff had, there was no reason for the Defendant not to have paid him as she was earning a monthly salary of S$4,000 from Sibre Brakes, and it was admitted by the Plaintiff that she was getting S$5,031 from Uni-Port[^27]. That was a handsome sum of about S$9,031 _per_ month. It is the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff’s not making a demand for repayment meant that it was a gift and not a loan.[^28]

27     Defendant’s Counsel also highlighted that the S$1,000 Taobao purchases were made before 14 August 2016. This was admitted to be so by the Plaintiff.[^29] As such, the Plaintiff’s claim for this alleged loan “therefore falls outside his amended \[Statement of Claim\]”’;[^30] “\[t\]he Plaintiff’s claim therefore fails on the 1st hurdle”, so submitted Defendant’s Counsel.

## My Decision

28     I am unable to agree with the Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff’s claim falls outside the amended Statement of Claim. Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) refers to the “friendly loans” which were extended to the Defendant. The relevant period was stated as “_\[o\]n or around_ 14 August 2016 to 5 February 2017” (my emphasis). That could mean on or after 14 August 2016, it could also mean _before_ 14 August 2016. As there is no evidence that it was not “on or around 14 August 2016”, the Plaintiff’s claim for this item is therefore valid.

29     It is not disputed that the Defendant was getting a monthly salary of about S$9,031 when she was working at Uni-Port and Sibre Brakes. She could certainly well afford to repay the S$1,000 to the Plaintiff for the Taobao purchases. The Defendant would like the Court to believe that that would be _if_ the parties had considered the loan to still be repayable, except that the Defendant was told that it was a gift.

30     During the trial, at this point of the cross-examination, Plaintiff’s Counsel had raised objections to which I now admit was also the thought I then had but was watching to see what the cross-examination would unfold. Plaintiff’s Counsel had explained his objection: “I can earn a hundred million---who’s to question me as to how I spend it and why---\[… \] I’m not repaying a loan of a $100.”[^31] So, whilst it would be obvious that if one was short of funds, a loan would remain unpaid, it does not mean that if one was in funds the loan would definitely be paid. If that were true, the sound conclusion would indeed be that if a loan remains unpaid, it must be because it was not a loan; it could be a gift like alleged in this case. However, we know in reality that even if one were in funds, a loan could still remain unpaid. The Defendant might therefore be earning a monthly sum of S$9,031 and still not repay a loan. Hence, it did not necessarily mean that the unpaid sum was in fact a gift.

31     As for whether the Plaintiff asked the Defendant to repay the sum for the Taobao purchases, both parties could only offer oral and bare assertions. The Defendant testified that the Plaintiff did not ask for the repayment of the S$1,000 for the Taobao purchases until 27 October 2017. It was also the day that the Defendant was terminated. By that time, the relationship between the parties had soured and so it would seem that the Plaintiff was getting back at the Defendant. It was in fact admitted by the Plaintiff in cross-examination that he was indeed angry with the Plaintiff when he terminated her.[^32]

32     However, the Plaintiff testified that he had raised the issue of the debt to the Defendant “at least 3 times” in 2016.[^33] The Plaintiff also referred to his email of 14 August 2016 to the Defendant and her husband’s joint email address whereat he informed her of the account details to which she could make repayment to.[^34] To the Plaintiff therefore, this had always been a loan.

33     For the help that the Defendant was to the Plaintiff in his time of need, Defendant’s Counsel suggested that the Plaintiff made a gift over to the Plaintiff of the Taobao purchases. For the help that the Defendant was, I would say that _that_ was the reason why there is little evidence and so few occasions that the Plaintiff raised the issue of the S$1,000 Taobao purchases to the Defendant. Like the Plaintiff had said, “During that time, I treat her like my own sister”.[^35] It would therefore not surprise that the Plaintiff would hold back on pressing for repayment.

34     It was in fact the Plaintiff’s steadfast evidence that as angry as he was when he terminated the Defendant, or as grateful as he was to the Defendant for her help when he was an “emotional wreck”[^36] – to use Defendant’s Counsel’s words – he had never told the Defendant that it was a gift. His position from the outset always was that it was a loan but the Plaintiff could take her time to repay him. He testified: “… when she start work with me, then I say after you get your salary, you have to slowly pay me back all the outstanding amount.”[^37]

35     It is not evidentially possible for the Plaintiff to prove that he did not say to the Defendant that this was a gift. It is therefore incumbent upon the Defendant to prove that the Plaintiff did say such to the Defendant. She has failed to do so. Not only did the Defendant fail to show the Court – other than her bare assertions – that the Plaintiff had told her that the Taobao purchases were a gift, the Defendant (“DW3”) had also admitted that she had understood that she had to repay the Plaintiff the amount:[^38]

PC:

 | 

… In para \[5\]---in line---on line 8, you say, “However, I insisted that I should pay him for the items.” Yes?

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

This is correct, the statement from me.

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

**So, you acknowledged and you accepted that you have to pay him or you would pay him for the items he bought for you from Taobao.**

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

**Yes. I did.**

 |
| 

**… …**

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

The Plaintiff has bought items from Taobao for you, correct?

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

Yes, using his account.

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

“Yes.” And earlier, as in paragraph 5 of your AEIC, **you have accepted that you have to pay the Plaintiff back for these purchases, correct?**

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

So you will have to agree, and it follows that you owe him this money that he spent buying things from you from Taobao, yes?

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

I should say no.

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

That doesn’t follow, Ms. Nora. You have accepted that he bought you items. You accepted that you would have to pay him back. He has requested for that money. And now you are saying that you don’t have to pay him back, is that correct?

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

It’s because not the whole list that I requested him to buy. …

 |
| 

\[Note: Apportionment was not the Defendant’s pleaded case.\]

 |
| 

… …

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

**So, you insisted that you should pay him for the items. So, whether he bought it on his own accord, or whether you asked for it, you insisted that you will pay him back for all the items he bought for you, correct?**

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

Thank you. So once again, you accepted that he bought items for you from Taobao, yes?

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

Yes, he bought from his own account.

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

**And you agreed, and you insisted that you have to pay the Plaintiff back, correct?**

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

PC:

 | 

My point is, Ms. Nora, you have accepted that he bought for you something. **You have accepted that you have to pay him back, or you agreed or insisted that you have to pay him back. He has asked you for that money. So, now you owe him that money. You must pay him that money, correct?** That is my point.

 |
| 

DW3:

 | 

**Yes.**

 |

  
  

(My emphasis in bold.)

36     Flowing from the above, it is acknowledged by the Defendant that the Plaintiff had bought items from Taobao for her, whether upon her request or otherwise. She had actually understood that she had to repay the Plaintiff for them. Yet, she did not.

37     There is therefore no evidential support for the Defendant’s case and her bare assertions that the Plaintiff had told her that the S$1,000 Taobao purchases of household items were a gift. Contrarily, there is documentary evidence from the Plaintiff that the purchases were repayable by her. There was at least the email of 14 August 2016.[^39] There is also no evidence that this position was superseded or changed by any intervening act or event. The S$1,000 purchases was therefore a loan to the Defendant by the Plaintiff and so, must be repaid to the Plaintiff.

38     In summary, given the relationship between the parties in 2016, it is reasonable for the Plaintiff to not have pressurised or made demands of the Defendant for repayment. I find this to be the more credible, on a balance of probabilities, than that the S$1,000 Taobao purchase was a gift. The Plaintiff has therefore successfully discharged his burden of proof with regard to the S$1,000 Taoboa purchase that it was a loan to the Defendant. There was also no evidence that the loan was ‘converted’ to a gift subsequently.

## ISSUE 2: THE S$836.70 DENTAL EXPENSE – REPAYABLE BY THE DEFENDANT OR REIMBURSABLE BY THE EMPLOYER?

## The Plaintiff’s Case

39     It is a fact of the case that the Plaintiff paid for the Defendant’s dental treatment amounting to S$836.70 on 7 March 2017. Once again, it is the Plaintiff’s case that this expense was a loan.

40     At that time, the Defendant was also an employee of the Plaintiff’s two companies, Uni-Port and Sibre Brakes. However, it is not disputed that the Defendant’s employment contract with the companies did not cover any dental treatment.[^40]

## The Defendant’s Case

41     It was not denied by the Defendant that the Plaintiff did not say that the S$836.70 for dental was a gift.[^41] It is the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had told her that Sibre Brakes would cover her dental expenses.[^42]

42     Just 6 days before that, on 1 March 2017, the Defendant had signed the employment contract with Sibre Brakes. She was therefore aware that dental was not a medical benefit of her employment. However, she testified that the Defendant had told her otherwise as he was the managing director of Sibre Brakes:[^43]

> “... he was telling me that he is the MD of the company. He decide and he approve, and that’s why he used his credit card to make the payment.

43     The Defendant in fact believed that the Plaintiff had received the reimbursement from Sibre Brakes.

## My Decision

44     It is clear and not in dispute that dental claims were specifically excluded as a medical benefit of Sibre Brakes. The employment contract provides:

> You will be entitled to be reimbursed for your medical (**excluding dental**, ophthalmic, X-rays and Laboratory tests) attention fees for treatment of minor and common ailments up to a maximum limit of SGD 50.00 per bill. …

(My emphasis.)

45     For the Defendant to succeed in her Defence therefore, this Court has to find that the Plaintiff did in fact tell the Defendant, from his position as managing director of the company, that Sibre Brakes would cover her dental expense. However, again, there is no such evidence before me, save for the Defendant’s unsupported assertions.

46     There is also nothing said about the dental expenses being a gift from the Plaintiff.[^44]

47     Defendant’s Counsel argues that the Defendant’s assertion that the Plaintiff had said that he would claim from the company is true. This is because of the parties’ good relationship; the absence of evidence that the Plaintiff had made requests for repayment of the S$836.70; and the Defendant would be financially capable of repaying the Plaintiff. These reasons were also submitted for the issue of the S$1,000 Taobao purchases. This Court has already addressed those arguments and the reasons why the reasons should be dismissed also apply here.

48     The Defendant further deposed[^45] that her Counsel had requested of the Plaintiff Sibre Brake’s financial statements for April and May 2017[^46] but the Plaintiff had chosen not to produce them. Defendant’s Counsel urged that adverse inference be drawn for the failure to produce. He explained:[^47]

> The production of such documents would have clearly shown that the Plaintiff did not claim reimbursement from Sibre \[Brakes\] for the Defendant’s dental expenses.

49     I am unable to appreciate the above argument. How does it matter if the Plaintiff had claimed reimbursement from Sibre Brakes for the Defendant’s dental expenses? So what if he had claimed? So what if he had not claimed? What is pivotal is the evidence of whether he told the Defendant – in his capacity as managing director of Sibre Brakes – that Sibre Brakes would cover the expenses. If the Plaintiff did tell the Defendant that, then it is left to him to claim from Sibre Brakes what he had expended for the Defendant. It should be irrelevant to the Defendant whether the Plaintiff had claimed or not claimed from Sibre Brakes.

50     As there was no evidence that the Plaintiff – as managing director of Sibre Brakes – had made an exception for Sibre Brakes to cover the Defendant’s dental expense, or that he had even told the Defendant that, his having charged the Defendant’s dental treatment to his credit card remained a loan which is outstanding, due and payable. The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for the amount of S$836.70 must succeed.

## ISSUE 3: DOES THE PLAINTIFF OWE THE DEFENDANT S$28,000?

51     This is the Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff for an alleged loan of S$28,000.

52     According to the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim,[^48] the S$28,000 was “monies lent by \[the Defendant\] to the Plaintiff”.[^49] Her nett monthly salary from Sibre Brakes was S$4,000. Instead of receiving her salary for the months of March 2017 to September 2017, it is the Defendant’s case that she had lent the 7 months’ salary to the Plaintiff since the Plaintiff told her that he had “financial problems and requested if he could use her salary to tide him over”.[^50]

53     It is trite to state that a corporate entity is its own legal entity, separate and distinct from the persons who operate it. In the present case, however, both the Defendant and the Plaintiff appear to have melded the Plaintiff with his company, Sibre Brakes. Of course this is legally erroneous, particularly when Sibre Brakes is incorporated as a private limited company.[^51]

54     Regarding the alleged loan of S$28,000 from the Defendant to the Plaintiff, there was no evidence before me that a loan was directly made from the Defendant to the Plaintiff. Both parties’ arguments had gone along the line that if salary was not paid, it was only because the Plaintiff, being the managing director of Sibre Brakes, had borrowed it from the Defendant simply by taking it directly from Sibre Brakes or not releasing the Defendant’s salary to her. It therefore follows that if there was no salary issue, that means that there was no loan amount outstanding.

## The Defendant’s Case

55     It is not disputed that the Defendant had filed a claim for salary at TADM against Sibre Brakes.[^52] It is noteworthy that the claim period is for 1 March 2017 to 27 October 2017. I understand that if mediation was not successful, the claim would escalate to the Employment Claims Tribunals (“**ECT**”).[^53] As the ECT has jurisdiction limited to a claim of S$20,000, the Defendant therefore capped her claim amount to S$20,000 instead of S$28,000 at S$4,000 per month for 7 months.

56     After the parties had attended at TADM for the mediation, on 26 December 2017, the Defendant signed a Withdrawal of Claims Form (“**Withdrawal Form**”).[^54] Printed on the Withdrawal Form were these words:

> I hereby confirm that I have decided not to pursue my claims further through TADM.

> I have received S$6,500 (handwritten) from the Respondent by… (cash; bank transfer; cheque)

And the Defendant signed her name, NRIC number and dated the document.

57     It is Defendant’s Counsel argument that “\[t\]he form merely states that the Defendant confirms that she has decided not to pursue her claim further through TADM. Such a term clearly cannot mean that the Defendant’s claim is fully and finally settled.”[^55]

58     Defendant’s Counsel also asked the Court to find against the Plaintiff for the reasons that the Plaintiff was unable to provide details of how or when the cash cheques for the Defendant’s salaries were paid to her, that the payment vouchers produced were unsigned, that the Plaintiff’s accounts staff was not called to the witness stand to explain some discrepancies such as the dates which are different on the cheques for the Defendant’s salaries and the payment vouchers, amongst other arguments.

## The Plaintiff’s Case

59     The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant only made oral requests for the repayment of the alleged S$28,000 loan, as compared with the Plaintiff who had made two police reports, emailed the Defendant about the outstanding payments, attempted to get the Plaintiff to sign the IOU, and issued a letter of demand. Plaintiff’s Counsel submitted that this was “telling of the veracity of the claims…”[^56]

60     Plaintiff’s Counsel also referred to the Defendant’s claim at TADM and submitted that she should not now be allowed to claim before the civil Courts since she had accepted the S$6,500 for her salary claim from 1 March 2016 to 27 October 2017 from Sibre Brakes. Further, over at TADM, it was salary claim and the same has now undergone a “self-serving transformation\[\]”[^57] to a loan before the present Court.

61     The Plaintiff also produced images of the following cash cheques all issued by Sibre Brakes:

> (a)     cheque dated 30 March 2017 of amount S$2,000;[^58]

> (b)     cheque dated 6 April 2017 of amount S$2,000;[^59]

> (c)     cheque dated 28 April 2017 of amount S$4,000, with payment voucher dated the same and indicating that it is for April 2017 salary;[^60]

> (d)     cheque dated 1 June 2017 of amount S$4,000, with payment voucher dated the same and indicating that it is for May 2017 salary;[^61]

> (e)     cheque dated 23 June 2017 of amount S$4,000, with payment voucher dated 29 June 2017 and indicating that it is for June 2017 salary;[^62]

> (f)     cheque dated 28 July 2017 of amount S$4,000, with payment voucher dated the same and indicating that it is for July 2017 salary;[^63] and

> (g)     cheque dated 25 August 2017 of amount S$4,000, with payment voucher dated 21 September 2017, indicating that it is for August 2017 salary.[^64]

## My Decision

62     The onus is of course on the Defendant, being the plaintiff in this counter-claim, to prove her case on a balance of probabilities.

63     The Defendant’s case is that for the period that she was employed by Sibre Brakes, she was not paid. Whilst incredulous at the thought, I kept an open mind to see how the evidence would unfold. However, I have found the Defendant’s counter-claim incredible. Even if it were true that she had pestered the Plaintiff for it, but to continue working for more than half a year without salary? I find that unbelievable.

64     S$28,000 is no small amount by most standards. The Defendant had admitted to taking loans from the Plaintiff: S$1,000 on 16 September 2016; S$7,500 on 11 November 2016, and not repaying the S$870.40 charged to the Plaintiff’s card on 5 February 2017. The Defendant’s husband, Mr Mohd Ashik Bin Ahmad (“**DW2**”) was also working hard at his job of being a Grab and Gojek driver.[^65] There is no explanation why the Defendant would lend the Plaintiff such a huge amount; unlike the Plaintiff to the Defendant, the Defendant was not beholden to the Plaintiff.

65     The Defendant had also admitted to the loans from the Plaintiff which is a total of S$9,370.40, the latest being the one for the chalet booking on 5 February 2017. If, she had lent S$28,000 to the Plaintiff as claimed, she would have had a clear defence when the Plaintiff demanded for repayment from her. It would have been instinctive for her to retort and remind the Plaintiff that he owed her much more. There was no evidence before the Court that she did. It was the same when on 3 August 2018, the Plaintiff’s lawyers sent the Defendant a letter of demand.[^66] There was no reply from the Defendant to this letter.

66     When the Defendant lodged her employment claim at TADM against the Plaintiff, it was for the whole period of 1 March 2017 to 27 October 2017. However, the Plaintiff was prepared to abandon part of her claim, from more than S$28,000 (to include October 2017’s part-month’s pay) to S$20,000. In the end, she was even willing to accept just S$6,500 from the Defendant. She thus gave up more than S$21,500 of what she was arguing was due to her when the Plaintiff’s total claim against her, at S$11,207.10, was only about half of that. She had explained that of the S$6,500 she received as a result of the TADM claim, S$4,000 was for her October 2017 salary (even though she did not complete the month) and S$2,500 was the notice pay. It therefore appears that at TADM, the Defendant had grossly conceded her claim for the period of 1 March 2017 to 30 September 2017. Now, she claims the same here as a counter-claim. Like Plaintiff’s Counsel described, “\[t\]he Defendant is effectively trying to make two attempts in different forums”.[^67]

67     At first glance, it is unclear if the TADM Withdrawal Form was as a result of a settlement between the parties and would have the effect of discharging the claim lodged. However, giving the Withdrawal Form its plain reading, I agree with Defendant’s Counsel that it merely states that the Defendant no longer wished to pursue her claim at TADM.

68     This is to be distinguished from a scenario where the claim had escalated to the Employment Claims Tribunals. If it had escalated, the Defendant’s having abandoned the excess by claiming S$20,000 instead of S$28,000, would, by section 15(2) of the Employment Claims Act 2016 (No. 21 of 2016), “fully discharge\[ \] all demands in respect of the claim”.[^68] Section 15(3) of the same Act also makes it clear that there can be no second bite of the cherry:

> Where the claimant has abandoned the excess amount, the claimant cannot recover that amount in a tribunal or any other court.

69     The claim at TADM, however, ended at TADM and did not escalate to the Employment Claims Tribunals. The effect of the Withdrawal Form must therefore be what is stated on the face of the document.

70     I should point out, however, that on 30 December 2017, following what transpired in TADM on 26 December 2017, the Plaintiff had emailed to the Defendant in the following words: “As agreed, you want to split the loan repayment from the **settlement** on 26 December 2017.”[^69] (My emphasis.) The email then went on to provide the Plaintiff’s bank details and an IOU form for the Defendant to sign. It therefore appears that, as far as the Plaintiff was concerned, there was a settlement.

71     My difficulty with that being a settlement, and so would discharge the claim, is that it has not translated to a “Settlement Agreement”. Rule 37 of the Employment Claims Rules 2017 states:

> Where a specified employment dispute is settled at a mediation under Part 2 of the Act,… the parties to the settlement must enter into a settlement agreement in the Form set out in the Second Schedule.

The Second Schedule to the Rules prescribes the form that is to be used for such settlements. The ‘settlement’ that was suggested in the email by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on 26 December 2017 was nowhere near that, whether in form or spirit. So, despite the claim lodged at TADM, the Defendant’s claim for salary, as a result of the Plaintiff allegedly borrowing the same from the Defendant, is still unresolved.

72     Even if the fact of the Defendant accepting S$6,500 at TADM does not discharge her entire claim for the period of 1 March 2017 to 27 October 2017, I have considered that the Plaintiff has produced ample evidence of cash cheques and payment vouchers to persuade this Court that the Defendant had received her salary. Defendant’s Counsel had raised questions about the cheques and the payment vouchers such as the discrepancy in the date for the payment voucher and the cheque when they were meant for the same month. I have not found these questions sufficient to raise doubts or cast shadow on the veracity of the Plaintiff’s evidence.

73     On questions of fact, the Court has often to look at the evidence cumulatively rather than singly, in the same way that the colour yellow is yellow and the colour blue is blue, but when mixed, it gives the colour green. So, looking at the evidence singly paints a different picture from when looked at cumulatively. So, in the present case, looking at the evidence _in toto_, I am persuaded that the Defendant’s counter-claim of a S$28,000 loan made to the Plaintiff was more unlikely than likely. There is the evidence of the salary or payment vouchers and cheques for almost all the months; the disproportioned readiness of the Defendant to compromise S$21,500 on her claim at TADM while fiercely arguing against paying the Defendant S$11,207.10; the totally no-reference to the perfect defence of her S$28,000 loan to the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff had demanded that she pay the S$11,207.10 and no suggestion of a set-off; and the incredible tale of working more than seven months without salary because the Plaintiff had requested for a loan.

74     In other words, on a balance of probabilities, the Defendant has failed to prove her case of the S$28,000 loan to the Plaintiff.

## CONCLUSION ON THE CLAIM & COUNTER-CLAIM

75     Flowing from the above, as the Defendant has failed to discharge her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that there was a loan of S$28,000 made to the Plaintiff, the Defendant’s counter-claim is dismissed.

76     The Plaintiff has proven his case on a balance of probabilities that the S$1,000 Taobao purchases paid by him was a loan to the Defendant for her household items. The S$836.70 paid for the Defendant’s dental treatment was also a loan to the Defendant. There is no evidence before me that the S$836.70 for dental and the S$1,000 Taobao purchases were gifts.

77     As the Defendant had admitted to three items of the Loans, and the Court has found the S$1,000 Taobao purchases and the S$836.70 dental expenses to also be loans, by _Gobind Lalwani_’s case earlier cited, there is no issue that the liability to pay has arisen for the total amount of S$11,207.10.

78     I therefore order as follows:

> (a)     that the Defendant satisfies payment to the Plaintiff at the sum of S$11,207.10;

> (b)     that interest be allowed at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ to the date of Judgment; and

> (c)     Costs to be agreed or to be fixed by me, if not agreed.
