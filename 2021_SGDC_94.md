Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases – Claim for full-time caregiver

18 May 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       Among other issues, this case poses the challenge of assessing a claim for a full-time caregiver in the presence of uncontradicted evidence that other members of the same household would also benefit from the provision of a full-time caregiver.

2       The plaintiff’s claim arises out of a road traffic accident (“the Accident”) that occurred on 26 May 2015. The plaintiff was travelling with seatbelt fastened as a back-seat passenger in a motorcar when it was rear-ended by a 14-feet lorry driven by the second defendant who was then driving as the first defendant’s servant and/or agent (collectively “the defendants”).

3       Interlocutory judgment in the plaintiff’s favour was entered by consent on 11 August 2016 with the issue of damages to be assessed and costs and interests to be reserved to the registrar hearing the assessment (“the AD Hearing”).

4       The plaintiff was born on 15 November 1940 and was accordingly 74 years old at the time of the Accident. As at the commencement of the AD Hearing, she was 79 years old and is now 80 years old as at the time of judgment.

## Witnesses in the AD Hearing

5       I conducted the AD Hearing over nine tranches where the following witnesses gave their evidence in the following order:

> (a)     the plaintiff;

> (b)     Ms Lim Li Hia (“Ms Lim”) – the plaintiff’s daughter that lives with the plaintiff in the same household;

> (c)     Mr Alexandra Harvard-Walls – the plaintiff’s physiotherapist;

> (d)     Dr Ho Li Chin (“Dr Ho”) – the plaintiff’s accident and emergency doctor;

> (e)     Dr Ko Soo Meng (“Dr Ko”) – the plaintiff’s treating psychiatric expert;

> (f)     Dr Teo Yee Hong (“Dr Teo”) – the plaintiff’s orthopaedic expert doctor;

> (g)     Mr Tan Yien Hwee – the defendants’ private investigator (“the PI”);

> (h)     Dr Brian Yeo Kah Loke (“Dr Yeo”) – the defendants’ re-examining psychiatric expert;

> (i)     Dr Sarbjit Singh (“Dr Singh”) – the defendants’ re-examining orthopaedic expert;

> (j)     Ms Alexi Lau – the plaintiff’s physiotherapist; and

> (k)     Dr Hee Hwan Tak (“Dr Hee”) – the plaintiff’s treating orthopaedic expert.

## Plaintiff’s submissions on quantum

6       The parties had initially agreed to the quantum for two minor heads of claim in the joint opening statement (“JOS”) as follows:

> (a)     minor head injuries: $1,000; and

> (b)     upper body injuries (pain over the left ribcage and right upper arm respectively): $1,000.

7       In the closing submissions, while I note that the defendants have now made arguments to the contrary in relation to both these injuries,[^1] no explanation is provided by the defendants for this marked departure from the JOS. Further, and in any event, despite the plaintiff’s averment in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) to these injuries[^2] and Dr Hee’s reference to these injuries in his specialist medical report,[^3] neither the plaintiff nor the relevant medical experts were cross-examined on these injuries by the defendants. In the circumstances, I award $1,000 each for these two injuries (as the plaintiff claims and as the defendants submit in the alternative to their primary submission of no award).

8       Additionally, the plaintiff claims for the following damages in the AD Hearing:

> (a)     General damages:

>> (i)       Pain and suffering for neck injuries: $24,000;

>> (ii)       Pain and suffering for lower back injuries: $16,000;

>> (iii)       Pain and suffering for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”): $35,000;

>> (iv)       Future medical and transport expenses: $4,811.04; and

>> (v)       Future costs of full-time caregiver: $120,243.

> (b)     Special damages:

>> (i)       Medical expenses: $32,791.34;

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $1,652.39;

>> (iii)       Costs of catered meals for one month: $198; and

>> (iv)       Costs of caregiving: $65,476.42.

9       As would be evident from the above and as the defendants point out,[^4] it is clear that the plaintiff’s total submissions on quantum exceed the District Court’s jurisdiction of $250,000 provided under s 19(4)(_a_) read with s 2 of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the State Courts Act”). Before me, there is no agreement to enlarge the court’s jurisdiction under s 23 of the State Courts Act. In the circumstances, even if the plaintiff is able to prove her entitlement to each claim itemised above, the maximum amount she can recover from the defendants in the AD Hearing is $250,000.

## General damages

### Pain and suffering for neck injuries

10     The plaintiff claims for the following injuries to her neck based on the medical opinion of Dr Hee:[^5]

> (a)     whiplash injury (grade unspecified);

> (b)     intervertebral disc bulges at C3/4 and C4/5;

> (c)     aggravation of pre-existing disc prolapses at C5/6 and C6/7 aggravated by the accident with resulting spinal cord oedema from the accident; and

> (d)     neck pain.

11     For the pain and suffering for her neck injuries, the plaintiff submits for $24,000.[^6] The defendants submit instead for a sum of $7,000.[^7]

12     In his report, Dr Singh made no mention of Dr Hee’s opinion on the plaintiff’s intervertebral disc bulges at C3/4 and C4/5 (see \[10(b)\] above) although Dr Hee appears to have agreed with the defendants’ counsel that such disc protrusions are not uncommon in elderly patients.[^8]

13     In any event, it is clear from Dr Hee’s opinion that the more serious neck injuries caused by the Accident are the disc prolapses and the spinal cord oedema (see \[10(c)\] above).[^9] The defendants do not dispute that the cord oedema was caused by the Accident.[^10] It is also common ground that the spinal cord oedema had subsided by 18 June 2016.[^11] As such, the main point of contention between Dr Hee and Dr Singh is whether the Accident had aggravated the pre-existing disc prolapses at C5/6 and C6/7.

14     Here, the defendants contend that there was no aggravation because the plaintiff did not suffer from any annular tear of the disc.[^12] With respect, I am unable to make this finding for the following reasons. First, Dr Hee had only noted that a tear “is possible” and not that this is an inevitable result or even a likely result of aggravation of pre-existing disc prolapses.[^13] Second, Dr Hee was consistent in his opinion that the “disc prolapses at C5/6 and C6/7 are pre-existent, but the accident worsened the disc prolapses”[^14] and even maintained this opinion during cross-examination after he had noted that a tear “is possible” in such a case.[^15] Third, as between the opinions of Dr Hee and Dr Singh, I am inclined to adopt Dr Hee’s opinion as he has sound and reasoned basis for the same[^16] and has been the plaintiff’s treating doctor since 4 June 2015 as opposed to Dr Singh who had only seen the plaintiff once (see also _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 25</span> at \[32\]).

15     In assessing the quantum for the neck injuries, the plaintiff refers to the “Moderate” category whilst the defendants refer to the “Minor” category in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) and I reproduce the extracts of the relevant ranges below (at pp 19–20):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="74.76%"> <col width="25.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description (Severity of Injury)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(b) Moderate</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(i) Severe whiplash injury classified as Grade 4 whiplash injury.

16     In my judgment, following my decision above that the Accident had aggravated the plaintiff’s pre-existing disc prolapses and given that the plaintiff has still been seeking treatment for her neck injuries six years after the Accident, the plaintiff’s neck injuries fall within the middle range of the “Moderate” category ((b)(ii) in the Guidelines) and I accordingly award her sum of $13,000.

17     Notwithstanding Dr Hee’s medical opinion that the plaintiff has a high risk of requiring cervical spine fusion surgery in the future,[^17] I do not find her condition to fall within the “Moderate” category (b)(i) particularly on account of her advanced age at the time of assessment. Here, it is trite that damages for pain and suffering are “awarded for both _future_ pain and suffering as well as for what has already been endured” (see _TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 543</span> at \[166\], citing _Birkett v Hayes_ <span class="citation">\[1982\] 1 WLR 816</span>) \[emphasis added\]. Given her advanced age, the plaintiff’s future pain and suffering is likely to be limited. For the same reason, as the defendants submit,[^18] the cases cited by the plaintiff can be distinguished as they all concerned far younger victims.

### Pain and suffering for lower back injuries

18     The plaintiff claims for the following injuries to her lower back:

> (a)     aggravation of pre-existing L4/5 and L5/S1 spondylolisthesis;

> (b)     lower back pain;

> (c)     radiating pain over left groin and buttocks, left thigh, left knee pain; and

> (d)     aggravation of chronic osteoarthritis in left knee.

19     While I agree with the defendants that the last injury itemised above to the left knee should have been categorised separately from the injuries to the lower back due to the different bodily part involved,[^19] this does not change the substance of the complaint. I therefore first deal with the knee injury before turning to the back injuries.

20     For the left knee injuries, the plaintiff submits $1,000 for the aggravation of the plaintiff’s pre-existing osteoarthritis of the left knee.[^20] The defendants submit primarily that no award should be made because the plaintiff’s left knee could not have sustained any impact from the Accident and there were no left knee symptoms recorded by any of the initial treating doctors. I disagree.

21     First, the plaintiff had stated that she had hit her left knee as a result of the impact during the Accident.[^21] The defendants’ attempt to challenge this version in the absence of any accident reconstruction expert is a nearly impossible task.

22     Second, Dr Hee’s opinion that the plaintiff’s “left knee osteoarthritis is chronic but aggravated by the \[A\]ccident”[^22] had not been challenged by the defendants during cross-examination.

23     In the circumstances, as the defendants submit in the alternative, the claimed sum of $1,000 for the plaintiff’s left knee injuries is a reasonable sum, which I accordingly award.

24     For the pain and suffering for her lower back injuries, the plaintiff submits for $15,000.[^23] The defendants submit instead for $2,000 or less based on their characterisation of the back injury as a mere back contusion.[^24]

25     For the back injuries, against the backdrop of Dr Ho’s opinion that any delayed onset of pain would take up to five days,[^25] the defendants’ main argument is that since the plaintiff first complained of lower back pain only seven days after the Accident on 2 June 2015, her complaints of pain to the lower back are due to her pre-existing conditions and not as a result of the Accident.[^26] With respect, I am unable to agree with the defendants on this point for the following reasons.

26     First, the plaintiff’s lower back injuries are not inconsistent with Dr Ho’s evidence that a delayed onset of pain could take up to five days. This is because there was a time gap of between two days from the date of the Accident (_ie_, for the second visit on 28 May 2015) and seven days (_ie_, for the third visit on 2 June 2015) for the plaintiff’s visits to Mount Alvernia Hospital (“MAH”) – the plaintiff could therefore have started to experience the lower back problems within the usual timeline of five days between the second and third visits to MAH.

27     Second, all the medical experts, including Dr Singh, agree that the plaintiff suffered injuries to her back.[^27]

28     The main issue for my determination here is therefore the severity of the plaintiff’s back injuries. Here, Dr Hee and Dr Teo are of the opinion that the plaintiff’s pre-existing back injuries were aggravated by the Accident[^28] while Dr Singh is of the opinion that the plaintiff suffered a simple back contusion.[^29] For the same reasons as above for the neck injuries, I agree with Dr Hee and Dr Teo that the pre-existing back injuries were aggravated by the Accident. As for the defendants’ suggestion that the evidence suggests that the plaintiff had largely recovered from her back injuries by 5 March 2016,[^30] I note that this suggestion is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s continued medical treatment for back. In any event, I am unable to make the finding that the defendants seek as this issue was not put to Dr Hee for his opinion.

29     It follows that the plaintiff’s back injuries fall within the lower end of the “Moderate” category in the Guidelines at p 23 and I accordingly assess the damages at $10,000. Again, as with the neck injuries, the precedents cited by the plaintiff are unhelpful given the advanced age of the plaintiff here.

### Pain and suffering for PTSD

30     For the condition of PTSD, Dr Ko had noted during his second review with the plaintiff that her mood “remained highly anxious and depressed, with persistent complaints and flashbacks and nightmares”.[^31] Here, the defendants do not dispute that the plaintiff suffered PTSD as a result of the Accident.[^32] The main issue again is therefore the severity of the plaintiff’s PTSD. With regards to quantum, the plaintiff submits for $35,000[^33] while the defendants submit for an award between $6,000 to $10,000.[^34]

31     The defendants’ main contention is that the plaintiff’s PTSD did not last beyond 8 October 2016 and that there was a break in chain of causation in respect of her PTSD condition when the plaintiff started to experience left hip problems.[^35] However, as the plaintiff rightly points out,[^36] this argument is devoid of merit as it is not backed up any medical evidence and is not even the opinion of the defendant’s own psychiatrist expert, Dr Yeo.[^37] In particular, Dr Yeo was clear during cross-examination that he has no grounds to dispute Dr Ko’s diagnosis of PTSD and that he did not make any other comments on the plaintiff’s PTSD in his report.[^38]

32     Most fatally, I am unable to make the finding the defendants seek in relation to the break in chain of causation because this was never put to Dr Ko for his opinion. In particular, Dr Ko was neither cross-examined by the defendants on the lapse of 979 days during which time the plaintiff did not seek treatment from him nor was he cross-examined on the issue of whether the plaintiff’s left hip problems was the primary cause of the relapse, if any, of the plaintiff’s PTSD condition.

33     Against this backdrop and despite the best attempts of the defendants’ counsel, Dr Ko was consistent in his opinion that the plaintiff’s symptoms are consistent with patients suffering from PTSD (some of the salient excerpts from his cross-examination are reproduced below):[^39]

> Q:    A breakdown can be an act?

> A:    It is possible. That is usually for younger patients, for older patients, I see no reason. That is why it is important to obtain a corroborative history from the family and also continuously review her mental state over time. _I see no reason why she should put up a show if there is no past psychiatric history of note_. Also, **_her presentation is very typical of 9 out of 10 PTSD patients. Also, when I saw her emotional distress, I believe her story._**

>     …

> Q:    In the \[p\[laintiff’s case, her evidence is that she was a homemaker ever since she got married and she was doing household chores up to the point of the accident. 2NE, Day 2, pp 8. But she disagreed with me that her pain that she is suffering now is from these household chores. Then during re-examination, she changed her answers to say that with age, anyone would feel such aches. That is an example. Given your earlier answer that there could be reason to doubt such patients, do you now have a reason to doubt the \[p\]laintiff’s subjective self-reporting answers to you?

> A:    On my part, I don’t think so. First, _her features are very typical of PTSD and were volunteered by her_. Second, I am not sure what the context of the questioning was. As mentioned, an anxious person, especially an elderly lady, when cornered, can be confused and the response can sometimes be ambiguous. In general, when she is more relaxed, she would be able to give a more better and accurate picture. If I do detect inconsistencies, I will go back again to check whether she really understood what I was saying.

>     …

> Q:    Does this, together with my earlier questions, give us any reason to doubt the veracity of her subjective self-reporting?

> A:    I would not jump to that conclusion. I would have asked why she said what she said. She could have been mistaken. **_The history so far, when she was re-examined, she had nightmares. That is very characteristic of significant PTSD_**_._ I find that there are more consistencies than some of these you highlighted which could be because of miscommunication or some other reason.

>     …

> Q:    At this surveillance report, when you see her outside of the clinical setting, bearing in mind her answers to the triage and her rather inconsistent answers on oath, does this give us any reason to doubt the severity of her self-reporting symptoms?

> A:     _I would again not jump to that conclusion_. I would like to know why she checked the different boxes at the A&E and when she was cross-examined, did she fully understand _etc_. Even the surveillance report, it is subjective – she did go out and socialise. But that is what I always encouraged her to do. To me that is a sign of motivation to want to get well rather than remain in a sick role.

>     \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

34     In assessing the quantum for the plaintiff’s PTSD, I take into account the opinion of Dr Ko (which was not contradicted by Dr Yeo) that the plaintiff’s PTSD symptoms have improved but have not been fully resolved[^40] and that the plaintiff would require another two years of psychiatric treatment with medication.[^41] As such, I find that the plaintiff’s condition fall within the “Moderately severe” category in the Guidelines at p 28. Having said that, I find that in view of her advanced age, the lack of any consequent effects of the PTSD condition on her employment (see the factors stated in the Guidelines at pp 25–26) and the range of awards cited by the plaintiff, her condition falls within the lower end of the Guidelines and I accordingly assess the damages for her pain and suffering at $12,000.

35     In particular, I stress that the authorities cited by the plaintiff do not support the claimed figure of $35,000 by her. Here, I find the plaintiff’s condition to resemble that of the plaintiff in _Chang Mui Hoon v Lim Beng Leng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHCR 17</span> (“_Chang_”) (where the plaintiff similarly suffered from PTSD after a road traffic accident and also required two more years of treatment – an award of $10,000 was made for the PTSD in _Chang_ taking into account the overlap with the concomitant condition of depression). While the plaintiff here appears to have marginally more severe symptoms than the plaintiff in _Chang_, the plaintiff in _Chang_ was almost half the age of the plaintiff here.

### Future medical and transport expenses

36     I turn now to the claim for future medical and transport expenses. Here, the plaintiff has clarified that she is only making a claim for future treatment for her PTSD condition. The plaintiff submits for $4,500 for future medical expenses and $311.04 for future transport expenses.[^42] The defendants submit for a nil award, following their earlier contention that the plaintiff’s PTSD condition had resolved much earlier and due to the break in chain of causation.[^43]

37     In determining whether a particular medical expense is reasonable, the court will consider a range of circumstances including, among other things, whether or not the particular treatment in question is necessary and whether or not it was taken pursuant to a doctor’s advice (see _Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 1003</span> at \[63\], citing UK Law Commission, _Damages for Personal Injury: Medical, Nursing and Other Expenses; Collateral Benefits_ (Law Com No 262, 1999) (Chairman: Robert Carnwath) at para 2.2).

38     Following my decision above at \[32\], on account of the defendants’ failure to put their case to Dr Ko, the opinion of Dr Ko on the need for the plaintiff’s future medical expenses[^44] for her PTSD condition remain unchallenged. During re-examination, Dr Ko clarified that the plaintiff would require two more years of psychiatric treatment and that the estimated costs for the treatment would be $4,500 (including consultation and medication).[^45] I thereafter granted leave for the defendants’ counsel to further cross-examine Dr Ko on his answers during re-examination but counsel failed to further cross-examine Dr Ko on the necessity for future treatment. I accordingly award the future medical expenses as claimed.

39     As for future transport expenses, Dr Ko noted that the plaintiff would require about “20 or less sessions”.[^46] Based on that and the plaintiff’s calculation of $12.96 per round trip,[^47] I award the plaintiff future transport expenses for a total sum of $259.20.

### Future costs of full-time caregiver

40     On the final head of claim for general damages for hiring a full-time caregiver, I first note that the parties’ submissions leave much to be desired – both parties did not adequately address the relevant legal principles and/or case precedents. This posed a significant challenge for me to decipher the fair and just outcome on this head of claim.

41     The plaintiff claims $120,243 for the costs of engaging a full-time foreign domestic worker till the rest of her natural life.[^48] This is based on a multiplier of six years and a multiplicand of $20,040.50. The defendants submit for a nil award, primarily contending that the plaintiff had admitted that she would require a domestic helper in the future even without the Accident.[^49]

42     I agree with the defendants in part. It cannot be gainsaid that as elderly persons advance in age, most of them would require caregiving assistance for day-to-day activities. This would especially be the case for a person with pre-existing medical conditions such as the plaintiff. For this reason, in my judgment, there would inevitably be over-compensation if an award is made for the costs of full-time caregiver for the full period of the plaintiff’s estimated life expectancy. In addition, I also have to take into account the following observation made by the High Court in _Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin Hon_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 407</span> at \[38\]:

>     … The maid will not be required to care for the plaintiff at times and she can even assist the plaintiff’s household chores. Therefore a discount should be allowed to take into account the value of the maid for other services and the fact that there is a payment of a lump sum up front for the services of a maid. …

43     These remarks are particularly apposite here given the PI’s observation that the plaintiff’s former domestic helper was seen washing their family’s motorcar on 17 April 2017.[^50] The plaintiff did not file any response to this particular observation in her supplementary AEICs despite having an opportunity to do so. For completeness, I note that unlike the case of _AOD (a minor suing by his litigation representative) v AOE_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 217</span>, there is no evidence before me that the plaintiff was primarily responsible for washing the family’s car before the Accident. To the contrary, the plaintiff had admitted during cross-examination that her eldest daughter, Ms Lim, did contribute to the household chores “from time to time”.[^51] Further, I also have to take into account the fact that the plaintiff’s husband is also of an advanced age (in fact, he is five years older than the plaintiff)[^52] and is therefore likely to benefit from the services of a domestic helper in their household.

44     Having said that, the defendants’ submission that no award should be made for costs of future care because the plaintiff is likely to require a helper to care for her even without the Accident goes against the medical evidence. Here, I note that Dr Hee had noted in his medical report back in 2015 that due to the “persistent pain in \[the plaintiff’s\] neck and back, she will find it challenging to do any housework, even if it is very light and sedentary”.[^53] Subsequently, Dr Hee maintained this opinion in his memo dated 16 May 2017, wherein he had noted that the plaintiff had “severe left gluteal/groin/thigh pain” and “right sided neck pain radiating to her head” and that these symptoms “started after the \[Accident\]”. Based on these observations, Dr Hee recommended that the plaintiff would need “a full-time caregiver on a _permanent_ basis” \[emphasis added\].[^54]

45     During cross-examination, Dr Hee also maintained his opinion as follows:[^55]

> Q:    Theoretically, for someone with chronic neck and back again, you would not recommend a permanent or full-time caregiver?

> A:    It depends on whether there are neurological issues in the arms and legs, which may happen as a result of the neck and back problems.

> Q:    Refer to 1PBD62, is this recommendation for caregiver due to the mobility issues caused by severe left glutal/groin/thigh pain?

> A:    Yes, these _are radiating symptoms to her left leg accompanied by left knee pain from the osteoarthritis. The left leg is not functioning well and mobility is one of the problems that she faces. I also mentioned here neck pain radiating to her head_.

>     …

> Q:    Refer to BA7, para 21. Bearing in mind that the Plaintiff says that she experienced extreme left hip pain in January 2017, you sent the Plaintiff for MRI for her left hip in May 2017 and the surveillance footage shows that she was holding her left hip region while walking in March 2017, could her holding of her hip be because of the left hip injury?

> A:    Yes, this is a contributor **_in addition to her other disabilities._**

>     \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

46     Dr Hee was also not cross-examined as to whether he would maintain his recommendation for a full-time caregiver in the absence of the left hip injuries. Further and in any event, the highlighted passage above puts paid to the defendants’ suggestion that the plaintiff’s need for a full-time caregiver, if any, exclusively arises from her left hip disabilities. Here, the medical evidence accordingly suggests that the plaintiff has residual disabilities arising from her (a) neck; (b) lower back; and (c) left hip (while the former two disabilities arise from the Accident, the left hip disabilities do not). Based on the evidence before me, I therefore am unable to agree with the defendants that an award for future costs of care should not be awarded. Instead, I take into account the fact that the plaintiff would additionally benefit from relief from her left hip disabilities in my assessment of the discount to be applied for the multiplier.

47     For the reasons stated above and adopting a rough and ready approach in the circumstances of the case, based on the plaintiff’s calculation that the plaintiff has an estimated ten remaining years of life,[^56] I find that a discount of 70% is appropriate for the multiplier here with the estimated breakdown for the discount as follows:

> (a)     30% discount for vicissitudes of life (see _Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 85</span> (“_Lee Wei Kong_”) at \[52\]);

> (b)     20% discount for overlap in services provided to other members of the household and lump sum payment; and

> (c)     20% discount for left hip disabilities.

48     The appropriate multiplier is therefore three years. As for the multiplicand, I question the breakdown of expenses for a total sum of $20,040.50.[^57] In particular, $30 per day for meal expenses is likely to be on the high side and I find that half the sum is more appropriate, especially in the absence of any evidence for catered meals per head. I also take into account the mandatory weekly day off for domestic helpers (which can fall on a Sunday during which time Ms Lim can look after the plaintiff). I accordingly find that the total costs of meal expenses for the domestic helper per year should be: $15 per day for 313 days = $4,695. The total multiplicand would therefore be: $13,785.50.

49     The total future costs of full-time caregiver that I am awarding is accordingly $41,356.50.

## Special damages

### Medical expenses

50     For medical expenses, the plaintiff claims a total sum of $32,791.34.[^58] The defendants submit instead for $11,518.22, raising three main issues. I deal with each of the defendants’ contention in turn.

51     First, the defendants object to the belated production of medical expenses incurred after the AD Hearing.[^59] I agree with the defendants here that since these medical expenses were not admitted before me either through a supplementary AEIC or a bundle of documents, out of fairness to the defendants who were in turn unable to cross-examine the plaintiff if they so wished to do so, these expenses ought to be disregarded. Even though the claim for medical expenses is a continuing one, there has to be a cut-off and any expenses incurred after the conclusion of evidence should be claimed under the head of general damages for future medical expenses instead (see also _Seah Yit Chen v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 490</span> (“_Seah Yit Chen_”) at \[14\]). But this was not done here.

52     Second, the defendants dispute the expenses for the medical consultation and physiotherapy for the neck incurred after 18 June 2016, medical consultation incurred for the lower back after 5 March 2016 and medical consultation incurred for psychiatric issues from 14 June 2019 onwards.[^60] It follows from my analysis on the pain and suffering above that the defendants’ objection to these medical expenses can no longer be sustained.

53     Third, the defendants dispute the claim for massage and hydrotherapy sessions, primarily on the basis that these sessions were not recommended by any of the medical experts and the plaintiff had already undergone physiotherapy as recommended.[^61] I partially agree with the defendants here in respect of the traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”) treatments as these sessions were not recommended by Dr Hee.[^62] In this respect, I reproduce the relevant passages from _Seah Yit Chen_ below (see also _Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 209</span> at \[41\]):

> 15    The test in any such case must be whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff to seek such “traditional” treatment and incur the expenses, and the answer as to whether it was reasonable must depend on the facts of each case. There should be some evidence before the court that _the traditional treatment was undergone on reliable advice, with a reasonable expectation of benefit, and not just on the impulse of the plaintiff. This would be especially relevant if the traditional treatment were to overlap a course of conventional treatment, as a plaintiff should not normally be entitled to recover the expenses of both forms of treatment undergone at the same time_. …

> 16    … In the instant case, she has already started with conventional physiotherapy and there is no evidence that she had received any reliable advice before she changed her mind and went to the Chinese physician on her own; there is also no evidence that she benefited in any way from this alternative treatment, and she was readily persuaded to stop it by Dr Kumar telling her that these visits to the Chinese physician would not help her to bend or squat. On the facts of this case, I am of the view that a proper claim has not been proved.

>     \[emphasis added\]

54     Even though the defendants did not specifically cross-examine the plaintiff on the TCM expenses, the test remains that all special damages have to be strictly proven in order to be recoverable (see _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 230</span> at \[31\] and \[42\], citing _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]–\[16\]). I find that the plaintiff is unable to discharge the burden in relation to the TCM treatments on account of these being undertaken without any medical advice.

55     However, for the hydrotherapy and acupuncture treatments, these were all undertaken pursuant to Dr Hee’s referral and advice[^63] and I therefore accordingly award them as claimed.

56     Based on my reasons above and the parties’ calculation undertaken after the hearing on 14 May 2021 where I had provided the initial parameters of my decision on medical expenses, I accordingly award a total sum of $25,808.49 for the medical expenses.

### Transport expenses

57     The award on transport expenses is inextricably aligned with my decision above on the entitlement for medical expenses. Again, based on the parties’ calculation, I accordingly award the plaintiff the sum of $2,569.66.

### Costs of catered meals

58     For the penultimate head of claim, the plaintiff claims $198 for the costs of catered meals for one month.[^64] This claim is supported by a catering meal invoice.[^65] The defendants submit for a nil award here in principle for the following reasons:[^66]

> (a)     the invoice for the catered meals stated that the order was for two persons and the plaintiff cannot recover the costs on behalf of others; and

> (b)     the plaintiff would have incurred meal expenses with or without the Accident.

59     I agree with the defendants. In fact, the plaintiff had admitted during cross-examination that Ms Lim, her husband and herself had consumed the catered meals during that month.[^67] Even if the argument is made that the plaintiff would have otherwise cooked for her family but for the Accident, then the proper claim would have been to deduct the average costs of ingredients required to cook for her family for one month from the costs incurred for procuring catered meals for a month. As this was not done and special damages have to be strictly proven, I disallow this claim in its entirety.

### Costs of caregiving

60     This final head of claim is broken into two parts and supported by relevant payslips and invoices as follows:[^68]

> (a)     loss of earnings suffered by the plaintiff’s daughter, Ms Lim from July 2017 to December 2018: $40,474.12; and

> (b)     costs of hiring domestic helpers from February 2017 to May 2017, June to August 2017 and December 2018 to January 2021: $25,395.42.

61     For similar reasons as stated above for general damages in relation to future costs of full-time caregiver, I find that this claim should be allowed.

62     As for the claim in loss of earnings suffered by Ms Lim, it is trite that this is recoverable in principle. In _Lee Wei Kong_, the Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff’s claim for his mother’s loss of income because it was a “reasonable cost of meeting the need created by the tort” (at \[53\]). Likewise, in the present case, Ms Lim had to make adjustments in her working schedule to care for the plaintiff, especially in those months when they could not get a domestic helper. Ms Lim first transited to a 3-day work week from July 2017 to July 2018, and thereafter to a 4-day work week from July 2018 to December 2018. In doing so, Ms Lim suffered from a loss in earnings.

63     Nevertheless, I would likewise apply a 70% discount here for both parts of this claim but for different reasons from the claim on general damages (there is no concern of vicissitudes of life and lump sum payment here).

64     First, I find that a 50% discount should be applied as a conservative estimate to take into account the overlap of the Accident injuries with the plaintiff’s left hip disabilities. Notwithstanding the defendants’ failure to cross-examine the experts on whether the plaintiff’s need for a full-time caregiver exclusively arises from her left hip injuries, I draw the inference that the plaintiff’s need for full-time caregiver _at the material time_ was triggered by her left hip injuries because the initial domestic helper application in January 2017 was made soon after the plaintiff started to first experience pain in her left hip.[^69] This therefore justifies a higher discount of 50% as compared to the claim for future costs of full-time caregiver (see \[47(c)\] above).

65     Second, I find that an additional 20% discount is appropriate for the overlap in services provided by Ms Lim and the domestic helpers to the other members of the household during the material time, especially given the uncontradicted evidence of the PI that the plaintiff’s helper was seen providing services to other members of the household on 17 April 2017 (see \[43\] above).

66     Applying the cumulative discount of 70%, I accordingly award the plaintiff $19,760.86 under this head of claim.

## Conclusion

67     For the above reasons, I assess the damages in the case as follows (Total: $132,254.71):

> (a)     General damages (total: $84,115.70):

>> (i)       Pain and suffering for minor head injuries: $1,000;

>> (ii)       Pain and suffering for upper body injuries: $1,000;

>> (iii)       Pain and suffering for neck injuries: $13,000;

>> (iv)       Pain and suffering for lower back injuries: $10,000;

>> (v)       Pain and suffering for left knee injuries: $1,000;

>> (vi)       Pain and suffering for PTSD: $12,000;

>> (vii)       Future medical and transport expenses: $4,759.20; and

>> (viii)       Future costs of full-time caregiver: $41,356.50.

> (b)     Special damages (total: $48,139.01):

>> (i)       Medical expenses: $25,808.49;

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $2,569.66;

>> (iii)       Costs of catered meals for one month: $0; and

>> (iv)       Costs of caregiving: $19,760.86.
