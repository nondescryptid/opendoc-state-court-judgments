### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused, a 45-year-old male, claimed trial to the following two charges:

> (a)     one count under s 354 of the Penal Code for outraging the modesty of the Complainant (“the s 354 charge”); and

> (b)     one count under s 354A of the Penal Code for aggravated outrage of modesty of the Complainant, with the use of wrongful restraint (“the s 354A charge”).

2       He was found guilty on both charges and sentenced as follows:

> (a)     Five months’ imprisonment for the s 354 charge; and

> (b)     Five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the s 354A charge.

Both imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently, giving a global sentence of **five years’** imprisonment and **six strokes** of the cane.

3       The Accused has appealed against both conviction and sentence. He is on bail pending appeal.

## Facts

4       The incidents in both charges (“the Incidents”) were alleged to have occurred in the Accused’s flat, on the night 3 September 2017. Prior to that, the Accused and the Complainant had met each other at four events, set out below:

> (a)      The CEO Group Event:

> Sometime in April 2017, the Complainant first got acquainted with the Accused at an event organised by a body called the CEO Group. Both of them had exchanged contact details then.

> (b)      The Brotzeit Dinner:

> Very shortly after the CEO Group Event, the Accused and the Complainant met for dinner at a restaurant called Brotzeit in Westgate, Jurong East.

> (c)      The Toastmasters Course:

> Sometime in August 2017, the Accused and the Complainant attended a course organised by the Toastmasters Club. During the course (which was held once a week over five weeks), they had occasion to speak to each other.

> (d)      The Bishan CC Speech Contest:

> On the evening of 3 September 2017, the Accused and the Complainant attended a speech contest at Bishan Community Club (“CC”). Later that night, they left Bishan CC and went to the Accused’s flat, where the Incidents allegedly occurred.

5       The testimonies of both the Complainant and the Accused revolved principally around these four events.

#### Prosecution’s Evidence

6       The Complainant testified that she met the Accused for the first time at the CEO Group Event, during which he was the official photographer. She had exchanged contact details with the Accused. Thereafter, they communicated via the WeChat platform. A log of the WeChat messages between the Accused and the Complainant, extracted by the police from the Complainant’s mobile phone, was adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P8A.

7       The very first message in Exhibit P8A was sent by the Accused to the Complainant on the night of 29 April 2017 (at 8.34pm). In that message, he had invited her to attend a course.[^1] The Complainant could not recall the exact date of the CEO Group Event, but surmised that it ought to have taken place on the day of this message, _ie_, 29 April 2017.[^2]

8       The Complainant testified that very shortly after the CEO Group Event, she met the Accused for the Brotzeit Dinner as he wanted to introduce her to a course in China.[^3] She deduced that if the CEO Group Event had indeed been held on 29 April 2017, the Brotzeit Dinner (which took place shortly after that) would have been sometime in early May 2017.[^4] In this respect, Exhibit P8A contained messages exchanged between the Accused and the Complainant on 30 April 2017, in which they had arranged to meet the next day, _ie_, on 1 May 2017. These messages, which continued to the early morning hours of 1 May 2017, are extracted below: [^5]

9       The Complainant testified that during the Brotzeit Dinner, she told the Accused that she was in the business of selling beauty products.[^6] She could not recall if, at the end of that dinner, the Accused had given her a lift back.[^7]

10     The next occasion on which the Complainant met the Accused was at the Toastmasters Course, held sometime in August 2017.[^8] According to the Complainant, she and the Accused bumped into each other once or twice during the course[^9] and may have exchanged simple greetings.[^10]

11     During the window of time between 2 May 2017 (_ie_, the day after the Brotzeit Dinner, according to the Complainant’s timeline of events) and August 2017 (when the Toastmasters Course was held), the Accused and the Complainant messaged each other intermittently over the WeChat platform. The relevant messages, as captured in Exhibit P8A, are extracted below: [^11]

The WeChat messages between the Accused and the Complainant ceased after 3 August 2017.

12     About a month thereafter, the messages between the Complainant and the Accused resumed but this time over the WhatsApp platform. The Complainant sent the Accused a WhatsApp message on 2 September 2017 (_ie_, one day before the Incidents), asking him if he could take photographs of her beauty products.[^12] This triggered a series of WhatsApp messages between Accused and the Complainant. A log of the WhatsApp messages between them, extracted by the police from the Complainant’s mobile phone, was adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P8B.

14     About two-and-a-half hours after the above exchange, the Accused sent another WhatsApp message to the Complainant, inviting her to attend the Bishan CC Speech Contest. The relevant exchange, as captured in Exhibit P8B, is extracted below:[^14]

15     Upon securing the Complainant’s agreement to attend the speech contest, the Accused followed up with an invitation to the Complainant to go to his flat. In doing so, he sought confirmation from the Complainant that her husband was overseas and asked if it was fine for her not to return home after visiting his flat. The relevant exchange, as captured in Exhibit P8B, is extracted below:[^15]

The Complainant testified that she found the Accused’s comments in the above exchange to be intrusive. She was shocked and thus chose to end the exchange by not answering his queries directly.[^16]

16     The next morning, the Accused sent the Complainant a WhatsApp message asking if she preferred to attend a singing event, in lieu of the Bishan CC Speech Contest. She replied that she preferred to stick with the speech contest. The relevant exchange, as captured in Exhibit P8B, is set out below:[^17]

17     Later that afternoon, the Complainant was giving a presentation about her beauty products at a community club. She did this with the assistance of her colleague, PW12 Teo Eng Heng (“Vincent Teo”). Thereafter, Vincent Teo fetched the Complainant to Bishan CC, where the speech contest was being held. At around this time, the Accused sent the Complainant a WhatsApp text message asking her if she needed a lift to Bishan CC but she replied that there was no need.[^18] Eventually, the Complainant was late for the Bishan CC Speech Contest. At about 7.46pm, she sent a WhatsApp message to the Accused telling him that she was at the Starbucks café at Bishan CC.[^19] The Accused came down to the café and brought her up to where the speech contest was being held. He ushered the Complainant to her seat before returning to his own seat.

18     Prior to the end of the speech contest, the Accused messaged the Complainant over WhatsApp, saying “let’s go”. The Complainant was under the impression that the Accused was telling her that the event was at its tail end and they should make an early exit.[^20] The message exchange, as captured by Exhibit P8B, is extracted below:[^21]

The Complainant thus went to the staircase at Bishan CC, where she met the Accused. The Complainant testified that he had then told her that he would send her home.[^22]

19     They both got into the Accused’s car. During the journey, the Complainant re-visited the topic of enlisting the Accused’s photography services (this being the subject that prompted her to reach out to the Accused via WhatsApp the day before). The Accused then told the Complainant that he would bring her to the place where he conducted his photography and show her his photography equipment and artwork.[^23] The Complainant agreed,[^24] having recalled that the Accused previously told her that he conducted his photography in Jurong.[^25] However, instead of driving to a photo studio in Jurong, the Accused drove to his flat in Jurong West.

20     After the Accused parked the car at his block of flats, he told the Complainant to wait downstairs while he went up first. Thereafter, at about 9.41pm, he sent her a WhatsApp message stating “Level 10”.[^26] Upon receiving this message, the Complainant duly proceeded up the block of flats to the tenth floor. The Prosecution tendered a video captured by a police camera mounted at the void deck of the Accused’s block of flats. The hour-long video, which bore a timestamp that began at 9pm and ended at 10pm, was adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P3-1. It showed the Accused first taking the lift up to his flat at about 9.14pm. Three minutes later, at about 9.17pm, the Complainant was seen taking the lift up. Nevertheless, the timestamp on the video in Exhibit P3-1 was slow[^27] by about 25 minutes, as the Complainant would likely have gone up the lift only slightly past 9.41pm.[^28]

21     When the Complainant arrived at the tenth floor landing, the Accused was waiting for her. Both of them proceeded into his flat. The Complainant recalled that she had left her shoes _outside_ the flat before entering.[^29] In the flat, both of them proceeded to the living area, where the Complainant sat down and took out the products which she wanted the Accused to take photographs of. The Accused, in turn, showed the Complainant some samples of his photography, captured on his mobile phone.

22     At this point, the Accused complained that it was warm in the living area and asked the Complainant to enter the bedroom, where there was air-conditioning. The Complainant was not comfortable with this.[^30] However, the Accused told her three or four times that he wanted to go to the bedroom[^31] and got impatient.[^32] The Complainant finally relented and followed the Accused, who went to the master bedroom. When both of them were inside the master bedroom, he switched off the light. When the Complainant objected, he switched the light back on. The Accused also closed the door. Again, the Complainant objected to this, upon which he opened the door.[^33] The Complainant could not recall if he closed the door once more after that.[^34]

23     The Accused and the Complainant then sat at the edge of the bed, where she tried to show him some photographs on her mobile phone.[^35] The Accused then put his arm around her waist[^36] and tried to nudge her closer to him.[^37] She reacted by pushing him away and telling him not to do that.[^38] The Accused pretended that nothing had happened.[^39] He then stood up and asked her to allow him to compare their respective heights.[^40] When the Complainant stood up, the Accused hugged her tightly and told her that he “needed”.[^41] She interpreted this to mean that he felt the desire for sexual intercourse as she could feel his erect penis jutting against her.[^42] This hug formed the subject of the s 354 charge:

> **MAC 905014/2018**

> You … are charged that you on 3 September 2017, sometime between 9.41 p.m. and 10.35 p.m., at Block 987C Jurong West Street 93 … , Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the Complainant\], (female / 39 years old at the material time), with the intention to outrage her modesty, _to wit_, by placing your hands around her waist and hugging her tightly, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code …

The Complainant told the Accused not to do this and tried to push him away.[^43] However, she was unsuccessful in doing so.[^44]

24     The Accused then pushed the Complainant onto the bed,[^45] where he quickly climbed on top of her, straddled her with his legs[^46] and used his hands to pin both her wrists against the mattress.[^47] He proceeded to kiss her face, ear and neck. The Complainant felt disgusted and kept shaking her head to the left and right to evade his kisses but the Accused countered by alternating his kisses between the left and right side of her neck.[^48] The Complainant started shouting at him to stop[^49] but he continued kissing her.[^50] When the Complainant’s blouse came untucked, the Accused released one of her wrists and used his free hand to reach under her blouse, from the waist up.[^51] He tugged at her bra,[^52] which came unhooked[^53] and was subsequently pushed up above her breasts.[^54] The Accused then used his hand to squeeze both her breasts.[^55] The Complainant felt pain when he did this.[^56] She tried to push the Accused away with her free hand but was unsuccessful.[^57] The Accused’s actions at this point formed the subject of the s 354A charge:

> **DAC 917713/2018**

> You … are charged that you, on 3 September 2017, sometime between 9.41 p.m. and 10.35 p.m., in a bedroom at Block 987C Jurong West Street 93 …, Singapore, did use criminal force on \[the Complainant\] (female / 39 years old at the material time), with the intention to outrage her modesty, _to wit_, by kissing her neck and face, unhooking her bra and squeezing both her breasts (skin-on-skin) and in order to facilitate the commission of the said offence, voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the \[Complainant\], _to wit_, by sitting on her hips and pinning her to the bed, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354A(1) of the Penal Code …

25     The Complainant continued shouting at the Accused to stop.[^58] By this time, the Complainant’s blouse had moved up to the level of her breasts.[^59] The Accused stopped squeezing her breasts, moved his head downwards and kissed her breasts. His kisses reached her cleavage[^60] but, before he could reach her nipples, she shouted very loudly.[^61] This shout, which was louder than the Complainant’s previous shouts,[^62] prompted the Accused to stop and stand up.[^63] With the Accused no longer straddling her, the Complainant seized the chance to get off the bed and run out of the master bedroom. She ran into the bathroom at the corridor outside the master bedroom[^64] and locked the bathroom door behind her.[^65] The Accused repeatedly knocked on the door.[^66] Fearing that he would break the door down, the Complainant pressed her body against the door.[^67]

26     While in the bathroom, the Complainant found a small pair of scissors,[^68] which she took hold of to protect herself.[^69] She then used her mobile phone to call Vincent Teo. This was at about 10.30pm, when Vincent Teo was with his wife and child shopping at Mustafa Shopping Centre.[^70] The Complainant asked Vincent Teo to come quickly and look for her. When he asked her where she was, she replied that she did not know. However, the Complainant used the Grab ride-hailing application to generate (with the aid of GPS) a map of her location.[^71] She then sent a screenshot of the map to Vincent Teo via WhatsApp. She also sent him an accompanying WhatsApp text message at 10.46pm, stating her location as “998 Jurong East”. In truth, this was the _wrong_ address, as the Accused’s block number was 987C Jurong West and not 998 Jurong East. The Complainant called Vincent Teo again to tell him that she was on the tenth floor and that he could identify the unit she was in by her red shoes, placed outside the unit.[^72] She also sent him another message at 10.47pm, telling him to “Come “faster”. The screenshots of the Complainant’s WhatsApp exchanges with Vincent Teo were adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P19.

27     Thereafter, Vincent Teo sent the Complainant a total of four voice clips via the WhatsApp platform. These voice clips, which were reflected in Exhibit P19, were played in court. I set out below the contents of these voice clips, as well as the Prosecution’s evidence of what transpired while these voice clips were being sent by Vincent Teo:

> (a)     At 11.05pm, Vincent Teo sent the Complainant the first voice clip, in which he said the following in Mandarin:[^73]

>> Don’t panic, I will let you know when I arrive. Don’t talk about anything else first. Wait for me to come over.

> The Complainant had responded to this by sending a message to Vincent Teo at 11.05pm, stating “Ok Faster My hp low batt”.

> (b)     Vincent Teo eventually arrived in the vicinity of the Accused’s block of flats. He left his wife and child in the car[^74] while he went to look for the Complainant. At 11.17pm, Vincent Teo sent the Complainant the second voice clip, in which he said the following in Mandarin:

>> I am coming up now but they \[_meaning the block numbers_\] are grouped by A, B or C. So, how do you want me to identify you?

> The Complainant testified that by then, she was neither able to receive Vincent Teo’s voice clips nor respond to them, as her mobile phone battery had gone flat.[^75]

> (c)     As explained above, the Complainant had correctly told Vincent Teo that she was on the tenth floor but had texted him the wrong block number. While the Accused’s block number was **987C** Jurong West, the Complainant erroneously told Vincent Teo that it was **998** Jurong East. She also did not cite the letter accompanying the block number (ie, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ _etc_). In the end, Vincent Teo ended up going to the tenth floor of **988B** Jurong West. At 11.22pm, he sent the Complainant, via WhatsApp, a photograph of a red pair of shoes that he spotted outside one of the units on the tenth floor (of block 988B). At 11.23pm, he sent her the third voice clip, in which he said the following in Mandarin:[^76]

>> … answer me. Is this the one? Is this your shoes?

> (d)     Finally, at 11.29pm, , Vincent Teo sent the Complainant the fourth voice clip, in which he said the following in Mandarin:[^77]

>> … answer me quickly. Correct or not, is this the unit?

28     When Vincent Teo still failed to get a response from the Complainant, he called for the police. The First Information Report, adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P9, is set out below:

29     In the meantime, the Complainant stayed locked in the bathroom. The Accused had stopped his knocking on several occasions, only to return to the bathroom door and knock again, in an attempt to persuade her to come out.[^78] At one point, when the knocking ceased for a while, the Complainant stepped out of the bathroom. However, when she saw the Accused standing at the doorway of the master bedroom, she promptly went back into the bathroom and locked the door again.[^79] Yet again, the Accused came knocking on the bathroom door, persuading her to come out. However, the Complainant told him to go into his room.[^80]

30     After a long period of silence, the Complainant stepped out of the bathroom again. This time, she saw that the Accused had gone into the master bedroom and shut the door.[^81] As the Complainant was afraid that the Accused might come out of the master bedroom, she took a chair[^82] from the living room, placed it next to the master bedroom door and used an electrical cable[^83] to tie the doorknob to the chair.[^84] The Complainant then went to the table to look for the keys to the flat. As there was a charging point below the table, she decided to charge her mobile phone, before resuming her search for the keys. After she found the keys, she took her bag and her mobile phone and left the flat.[^85] As she did so, she realised that her shoes were now inside the flat, when she recalled placing them outside the flat when she first came in.[^86]

31     The Complainant was anxious to leave the flat quickly as she feared that the Accused might come out and grab her. She thus headed for the lift without putting her shoes on.[^87] The Prosecution adduced a second video from the police camera mounted at the void deck of the Accused’s block of flats. This was an hour-long video, bearing a timestamp that began at 11pm and ended at 12 midnight. The video was adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P3-2. It showed the Complainant emerging from the lift at about 11.22pm although, as explained at paragraph 20 above, the timestamp on this video was likely slow by about 25 minutes or so (meaning that she likely emerged from the lift closer to 11.47pm). The video in Exhibit P3-2 showed that as the Complainant stepped out of the lift and onto the void deck, she was barefoot, with one hand holding her shoes and the other hand holding her mobile phone to her ear.

32     At the void deck, the Complainant saw Vincent Teo with a male police officer. When they asked her what happened, she cried and told them that nothing happened.[^88] The Complainant explained that she felt embarrassed to relay to them what had occurred[^89] and, as at that point, could only think of going home.[^90] Shortly thereafter, a female police officer, PW9 Woman Inspector Ng Hui Shan (“W/Insp Ng”), arrived at the scene. As she comforted and consoled the Complainant,[^91] the latter slowly revealed the ordeal she had just undergone.[^92]

33     The Accused subsequently came down to the void deck, where the police officers arrested him.

34     The Prosecution also tendered DNA reports, adduced as Exhibits P4 to P7. In a nutshell, these reports established the following:

> (a)     Traces of the Accused’s DNA _were_ positively identified on the Complainant’s blouse[^93] and the exterior of her skirt.[^94]

> (b)     The Accused’s DNA could _not_ be positively identified on the Complainant’s bra[^95] or stockings.[^96]

#### Evidence for the Defence

35     The Accused gave a very different account of what happened. By way of backdrop, he explained that he was in love with the Complainant and had invited her to his home for (in his words) “a tenderly good time”.[^97]

36     Like the Complainant, the Accused testified that both of them first met at the CEO Group Event. However, the Accused said that the CEO Group Event was held on 22 April 2017 and not 29 April 2017 (as deduced by the Complainant). In support of this, the Accused tendered a printout from his personal computer’s Windows Explorer page. The printout, which was adduced by the Accused as Exhibit D1-2, displayed the thumbnail images of various ‘.jpg’ image files. The Accused said that these files contained photographs, including those of the Complainant, which the Accused had taken at the CEO Group Event. The printout in Exhibit D1-2 showed the properties box of one of the ‘.jpg’ files that contained a photograph of the Complainant. The list of properties in the box indicated that the ‘.jpg’ file was created on 22 April 2017. The Accused thus relied on Exhibit D1-2 to say that the CEO Group Event was held on 22 April 2017 and not 29 April 2017.[^98]

37     As regards the Brotzeit Dinner, the Accused said that this took place on 23 April 2017, and not in early May 2017 (as estimated by the Complainant).[^99] The Accused tendered a printout of screenshots from his mobile phone. The printout, which was adduced by the Accused as Exhibit D2-1, captured images of SMS and WeChat messages between him and the Complainant purportedly sent between 23 and 25 April 2017. The Accused said that those messages sent on 23 April 2017 clearly showed him and the Complainant arranging to meet for dinner that day (_ie_, on 23 April 2017). The messages captured by Exhibit D2-1 are extracted below:[^100]

38     The Accused explained that the messages (between him and the Complainant) on his mobile phone were incomplete as he had deleted most of them, for fear that his wife and children would chance upon his communications with the Complainant. As such, he had pieced Exhibit D2-1 together from whatever messages remained on his mobile phone.[^101]

39     The Accused also claimed that it was the Complainant who invited him to the Brotzeit Dinner.[^102] He testified that during the dinner, the Complainant consumed two alcoholic drinks.[^103] After the dinner, he fetched her to her relative’s home in Jurong East. Upon arrival at her destination, the Complainant was reluctant to leave him.[^104] As she had no intention to alight, they sat inside the car and spoke for about an hour.[^105] During the conversation, the Complainant started sobbing as she spoke about her unhappy marriage, saying that she wanted to divorce her husband.[^106] The Complainant then moved her body towards him and they hugged, even as she continued recounting her family woes.[^107] The Complainant then kissed him before alighting from his car.[^108] While the Complainant only got acquainted with the Accused the day before, at the CEO Group Event (_ie_, on 22 April 2017, according to the Accused’s timeline of events), he thought that her behaviour at the end of the Brotzeit Dinner might have been attributable to her consumption of the two alcoholic drinks.[^109]

40     The Accused referred to the messages in Exhibit D2-1 that were purportedly sent on 24 April 2017 (which, according to the Accused’s timeline of events, was one day _after_ the Brotzeit Dinner). Specifically, the Accused pointed to the Complainant’s message sent at 6.22pm (extracted in the table at paragraph 37 above), saying that she was free after 9 o’clock. The Accused said that this demonstrated the Complainant’s satisfaction with the Brotzeit Dinner, as she was hoping to meet him again.[^110]

41     The Accused testified that after the night of the Brotzeit Dinner, his relationship with the Complainant deepened and their conversations grew more intimate.[^111] Effectively, he and the Complainant had entered into a romantic relationship and she was now his girlfriend.[^112] To illustrate the intimacy of their conversations after the Brotzeit Dinner, the Accused referred to the WeChat messages between him and the Complainant, captured by Exhibit P8A. He highlighted that the messages in Exhibit P8A, extracted in the tables at paragraphs 8 and 11 above, clearly carried a tone of endearment. To recapitulate, the messages sent by the Accused included the following:

> (a)     30 April 2017: “probably wish to see you badly”

> (b)     1 May 2017: “I do not dare to sleep alone \[_Sob_\]\[_Sob_\]”

> (c)     2 June 2017: “What are you busy with! Goddess”

> (d)     6 June 2017: We are not meeting \[_Sob_\]\[_Sob_\]\[_Sob_\]

> (e)     3 July 2017: Missing you baby \[_Rose_\]\[_Rose_\]\[_Rose_\]\[_Rose_\]

The Accused also clarified that many of the messages in Exhibit P8A began somewhat abruptly, without any introductory context, because his communications with the Complainant were not confined to text messages. He had also liaised with her via other channels, _eg_, telephone calls.[^113]

42     The Accused said that after the Brotzeit Dinner, he and the Complainant made at least 20 attempts to meet.[^114] The Accused claimed that they had gone so far as to make plans to travel overseas together.[^115] According to him, their plan to go overseas was evidenced by the WeChat messages exchanged on 4 May 2017 (extracted in the table at paragraph 11 above) where he had asked her “You want to (go back) together?” and she replied “I do not have visa”.

43     The Accused also highlighted that he knew many intimate details about the Complainant. He referred to his message on 2 May 2017 (extracted in the table at paragraph 11 above), where he asked the Complainant: “How was today’s court session?” He said that a person’s court affairs were private, so the fact that he was aware of the Complainant’s court attendance was yet another indication of their close relationship.[^116] Apart from her court attendance, the Accused also said that he could spout other intimate details about her, _eg_:

> (a)     Her husband is a Japanese national who is 20 years older than her;[^117] and

> (b)     She wanted to divorce her husband[^118] (as explained earlier, he claimed that this was revealed to him while the Complainant was sobbing in his car after the Brotzeit Dinner).

44     The Accused testified that when he and the Complainant finally met at the Toastmasters Course in August 2017, they took the opportunity to engage in intimate exchanges. For example, they would whisper sweet nothings to each other during the course.[^119] They would also exchange naughty words, with the Accused telling the Complainant that he missed her kiss.[^120]

45     The Accused testified that by early September 2017, he and the Complainant had been in a relationship for some 4½ months.[^121] As such, when she messaged him on 2 September 2017 to ask about his photography services, they did not talk about monetary compensation, as they were already in a relationship.[^122] That same morning (_ie_, on 2 September 2017), the Accused had sent the Complainant several explicit messages, as extracted in the table at paragraph 15 above. To recapitulate, these messages included the following:

> (a)     “Come to my house tomorrow night”

> (b)     “He \[_ie_, the Complainant’s husband\] had gone back to Japan?”

> (c)     “Is it okay if you do not go home tomorrow?”

> (d)     “He \[_ie_, the Complainant’s husband\] is not in Singapore right?”

The next morning, on 3 September 2017, the Accused even followed up with the message “Okay, see you tonight, baby” (see WhatsApp messages extracted at paragraph 16 above). The Accused said that these messages clearly signalled to the Complainant that he wanted to spend the night with her and she had in fact agreed to do so.[^123]

46     The Accused testified that on 3 September 2017, the Complainant attended the Bishan CC Speech Contest for a total of barely 25 minutes.[^124] This was because she had no real desire to attend the contest, her true objective being the rendezvous in the Accused’s flat.[^125] After they left the speech contest and during the drive to the Accused’s flat, they held hands[^126] and the Accused even placed his hand on her thigh.[^127] When they arrived at the Accused’s block of flats, it was the Complainant who had asked the Accused to go up to his flat to check if it was safe to go in.[^128] Thereafter, when the Complainant went up the lift to join the Accused in his flat, she was in a happy mood. As could be seen in the video in Exhibit P3-1, she had even preened herself when viewing her reflection in the glass panel of the notice board at the void deck, prior to going up the lift. The Complainant was thus happy to go to the Accused’s flat.[^129]

47     The Accused testified that upon reaching his flat, the Complainant had walked straight in, removing her shoes only inside the flat.[^130] He had then tried to hug her but she evaded his arms and went to sit on the living room sofa.[^131] She then asked him to sit beside her,[^132] which he did. The Complainant proceeded to take the beauty products from her bag and explain them to him.[^133] When they broached the issue of the Accused taking photographs of the products, the Accused took out his mobile phone and showed her some samples of his photographic work.[^134] During this discussion, the Complainant sat in very close proximity to the Accused. She used her thighs to touch his kneecap. When she turned, her breasts touched his elbows. The Accused surmised that the Complainant was sending him signals.[^135] He thus put his arm around her shoulder and subsequently around her waist, as well as placed his palm on her thigh. She did not object to any of this.[^136]

48     After they had spent about half an hour in the living room, the Accused felt that they had “nurtured the atmosphere” for quite a while.[^137] He thus invited her to go to the master bedroom. He also told her that he was going to use a condom.[^138] The Accused proceeded to turn on the air-conditioning in the master bedroom and invited her in.[^139] The Complainant followed him to the master bedroom but, along the way, suggested that they use the study room instead, as there was also air-conditioning there. However, the Accused preferred the master bedroom as there was a bed there but not in the study room.[^140]

49     Once they were in the master bedroom, the Accused closed the door. He tried to hug the Complainant but she went to sit on the bed instead.[^141] He walked over and told her that he wanted to compare their respective heights, upon which she stood up.[^142] At this point, they hugged affectionately.[^143] They then sat on the bed, with their backs leaning against the headrest, watching music videos.[^144] After a few minutes, the Accused put his hand around the Complainant’s shoulder and kissed her on the cheek and neck. Again, she did not object to this.[^145] Rather, she leaned backwards, looked up and closed her eyes. The Accused then kissed her on the lips[^146] but she responded by telling him “don’t play”,[^147] albeit in a melodious voice.[^148] The Accused continued to kiss the Complainant.[^149] His hand then reached under her blouse, moved upwards and started fondling her breast.[^150] He did so _without_ trying to unhook her bra.[^151] As his hand reached the upper part of her breast, she pushed him away.[^152] Throughout this, the Complainant never shouted.[^153] Given that it was past 11pm and the surroundings were quiet, the Accused explained that any shout by the Complainant would have alarmed the neighbours. No neighbours came running to the rescue that night because the Complainant never shouted.[^154]

50     After pushing the Accused away, the Complainant took her mobile phone, opened the master bedroom door and walked to the bathroom.[^155] She walked freely and in a leisurely fashion.[^156] She then locked herself in the bathroom and refused to come out despite the Accused’s repeated persuasions. After about one hour and 15 minutes, the Complainant directed the Accused to go into the master bedroom. He complied but left the bedroom door open. When the Complainant emerged from the bathroom and saw the Accused in the master bedroom, she told him to stay inside the master bedroom and close the door. Again, he complied.[^157] A few minutes later, the Accused heard the Complainant pulling a chair to the master bedroom door.[^158] That was likely the point when she tied the chair to the bedroom doorknob with the electrical cable.

51     After a few more minutes, the Accused heard someone unlocking the metal gate to his flat.[^159] The Accused deduced that the Complainant must have unlocked it, as he had earlier told her where she could find the keys to the flat.[^160] He then heard the voice of a man conversing with the Complainant. From the sound of the man’s voice, the Accused surmised that the man must have been either at the flat’s doorstep or inside the living room.[^161] After a few minutes, the Accused heard the sound of his metal gate again and reckoned that the Complainant and the man must have left the flat.[^162] Nevertheless, the Accused remained inside the master bedroom, listening intently. After confirming that there were no other sounds outside the master bedroom, he opened the bedroom door and came out.[^163]

52     The Accused explained that he had waited until the coast was clear before emerging from the master bedroom as he knew that he would not be able to explain himself had it been the Complainant’s husband who entered the flat. The Accused was certain that the man entering his flat would not have kind intentions and was afraid of being assaulted.[^164] The Accused was particularly concerned as he did not know exactly how many men had entered his flat and whether they were armed.[^165] In any case, the Complainant had instructed him to stay in the master bedroom and he was merely following her instructions.[^166]

53     As the Accused came out of the master bedroom, the electrical cable that the Complainant had tied to the doorknob came loose and dropped off.[^167] The Accused realised that the Complainant had, in departing from his flat, made off with the flat keys. Fearing that she might toss the keys somewhere outside the flat, he decided to go downstairs to look for the keys [^168]

54     When the Accused stepped out of the lift and onto the void deck, he saw the Complainant with the police. The Accused alleged that the police officers at the scene treated him rather roughly. For example, a female police officer shouted at the Accused and jabbed him with her finger.[^169] To diffuse the situation, the Accused offered to give his statement at the police station.[^170] The police then seized his mobile phone.[^171] The Accused was happy to offer his mobile phone for investigations but he also explained to the police that he had deleted many of the messages between him and the Complainant as he did not want his children to stumble upon these messages when playing with his phone.[^172] He thus begged the police to seize the Complainant’s mobile phone, as he hoped that the chat records from her phone could be extracted as well.[^173]

## Findings on Guilt

55     At the end of the trial, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty of both charges. I found the Complainant’s testimony to be unusually convincing. Her evidence was also consistent with the surrounding facts. In contrast, the Accused’s account of what happened was implausible in many respects. His testimony in court also contradicted the statement which he gave to the police during investigations.

56     I set out my grounds below.

#### The parties’ relationship after the Brotzeit Dinner

57     The Accused’s defence was painted against the backdrop of a romance that purportedly blossomed between him and the Complainant after the Brotzeit Dinner. According to the Accused, the events transpiring in his flat should thus be viewed against that context, _ie_, that he and the Complainant had already been in a relationship for some 4½ months by the time of the Incidents.

58     However, the Accused’s account of what unfolded at the end of the Brotzeit Dinner was out of the ordinary. The Complainant had met the Accused for the very first time only _one day_ before the Brotzeit Dinner (_ie_, at the CEO Group Event, according to the Accused’s timeline of events). Even then, that meeting was a fleeting one. Yet, after the dinner, she had fallen into his arms sobbing, confided in him about her most private marital woes and kissed him. Even if I accepted the Accused’ suggestion that the Complainant’s inhibitions may have been loosened by the consumption of alcohol, it was still quite unusual for someone in the Complainant’s shoes to behave that way with a person who was, up to that point, a virtual stranger.

59     The Accused postulated that as the Complainant’s husband was 20 years older than her,[^174] she could have come on to the Accused because she found him young and good-looking by comparison.[^175] To that end, the Accused tried to cross-examine the Complainant about her sex life with her husband.[^176] However, I held that line of questioning to be irrelevant and disallowed it.

60     More importantly, the Accused’s testimony of what transpired after the Brotzeit Dinner contradicted his statement to the police. The statement, which was recorded one the day after the Incidents, was adduced by the Prosecution as Exhibit P21.[^177] In paragraph 3 of Exhibit P21, the Accused gave the following account of the Brotzeit Dinner and what transpired thereafter:[^178]

> About 2-3 months ago, she invited me to drink alcohol at Westgate. I recalled she drank 2 alcoholic drinks but I did not drink. I drove her to a condominium in Jurong East. She claimed that she was going to visit her relative. After that, we still communicated via “Wechat” but **_our communications soon stopped as I did not really like her to keep asking me to join her business_**. \[emphasis added\]

There was no mention in the statement about the Complainant hugging or kissing the Accused, after they had reached her destination. This omission to mention something that was clearly of an exculpatory nature warranted an adverse inference being drawn against the Accused: see _Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 12</span>[^179]. I thus preferred the evidence of the Complainant, who flatly denied the Accused’s version of what occurred after the Brotzeit Dinner.[^180]

61     As will be recalled, it was also the Accused’s defence that romance had blossomed between him and the Complainant after the Brotzeit Dinner. This, argued the Accused, was evidenced by what he interpreted to be intimate messages (captured in Exhibit P8A) that he exchanged with the Complainant from the end of April 2017 onwards. By the time he next met the Complainant at the Toastmasters Course in August 2017, they were whispering sweet nothings to each other.[^181] However, the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P21 painted a very different picture:

> (a)     The portion of his statement extracted at paragraph 60 above stated that his communications with the Complainant stopped after the Brotzeit Dinner as he “_did not really like her to keep asking \[the Accused\] to join her business_”. As such, rather than depicting a blossoming romance, the statement actually portrayed the Accused as someone brushing off a pest.

> (b)     The Accused’s statement also said nothing about sweet nothings being whispered at the Toastmasters Course. To the contrary, it portrayed the Accused’s exchanges with the Complainant at the Toastmasters Course as being rather terse. Specifically, paragraph 4 of the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P21 stated:

>> In August, I had enrolled in a Toastmaster class at I-hub in Jurong East. On my first lesson, I saw \[the Complainant\] there and realized that she had also enrolled in the course. It was a 5-week course held on every Wednesday. Everytime I meet her there, **_I would just say hi-bye. We did not communicate much_**.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Paragraph 4 of Exhibit P21 thus corroborated the testimony of the Complainant, who rejected the Accused’s claim that they had exchanged sweet nothings at the Toastmasters Course.[^182]

62     During his cross-examination, the Accused was questioned about the omissions and contradictions within his statement, as set out above. He responded by challenging the accuracy of his statement. In doing so, the Accused levelled a wide array of allegations against the Investigation Officer, PW10 Assistant Superintendent of Police Lee Khum Thong (“ASP Lee”), who had recorded the statement −these allegations are listed at paragraph 92 below. For the reasons set out at paragraph 95 below, I rejected the Accused’s allegations as baseless and dismissed his attempts to challenge his statement.

63     As regards the Accused’s claim that he knew a lot of intimate details about the Complainant,[^183] I did not think that these details were particularly sensitive. The fact that the Complainant’s husband is a Japanese national and that he is 20 years older than the Complainant, as well as the fact that the Complainant was attending a court case, could very well have been shared between platonic acquaintances over a meal. As regards the fact that the Complainant had at one point contemplated divorce with her husband, this too was raised by the Accused as yet another intimate detail which the Complainant shared with him in private. [^184] However, I note that the Complainant’s intention to divorce her husband was disclosed by the Complainant during her examination-in-chief.[^185] There was absolutely nothing to show that the Accused was aware of this fact prior to the Complainant taking the stand. He certainly made no reference to it in his statement in Exhibit P21.

64     I thus rejected the Accused’s account of how romance had blossomed between the parties after the Brotzeit Dinner. If any romance had blossomed at all, it would have been strictly within the confines of the Accused’s imagination.

#### The text messages exchanged between the Accused and the Complainant

65     The Accused sought to rely on the WeChat and WhatsApp messages between him and the Complainant, to buttress his claim that they had entered into an intimate relationship after the Brotzeit Dinner. I have already concluded above that I reject any notion of romance blossoming after the Brotzeit Dinner. Nevertheless, given that parties devoted a large proportion of their efforts analysing the text messages, I will set out my views on them.

66     As alluded to at paragraph 41 above, the Accused argued that many terms of endearment were exchanged between him and victim, over the WeChat platform. However, a simple perusal of the messages in Exhibit 8A shows that the terms of endearment were unilateral, coming only from the Accused. The Complainant, who had either ignored or sidestepped these terms of endearment, never respond with any terms of endearment of her own.

67     I also found the Accused’s interpretation of the messages to be tortured. For example, as explained at paragraph 42 above, the Accused sought to rely on the following messages, exchanged on 4 May 2017, to suggest that he and the Complainant were so advanced in their relationship that they even made plans to travel overseas together:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.12%"> <col width="79.88%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Have you gone overseas?</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Not yet, miss me?</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aren’t you going back these two days?</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">When (are you) going back?</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">You want to (go back) together?</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I do not have visa</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

Looking at this exchange, I could not discern anything more than a rebuff from the Complainant. There was no hint, anywhere in the WeChat and WhatsApp messages, of the Complainant having ever agreed to go overseas with the Complainant. The Complainant explained that in the above exchange, the Accused was trying to invite her to an event in China but she had simply turned him away by telling him that she did not have a visa.[^186]

68     During the trial, the Accused tried to suggest that the text messages in Exhibits P8A and P8B were incomplete. Presumably, if there were text messages that had been omitted by these two exhibits, one could not rule out that there were in fact intimate messages between the Accused and the Complainant that had not been captured. However, I rejected this suggestion. Firstly, the Accused was unable to describe, with any level of particularity, just what messages _were_ missing and which could have assisted his case. Secondly, the cybercrime forensic expert called by the Prosecution, PW2 Janagaraj s/o Ganasekaran, testified that even if a WhatsApp or WeChat message had been deleted from a mobile device, the message logs that were forensically extracted would still contain indicators showing the points where the deleted message had once stood.[^187] He then testified that the forensic records of the Complainant’s mobile phone bore no such indicators, meaning that _all_ of the WeChat and WhatsApp messages in her mobile phone had been successfully captured in Exhibits P8A and P8B.[^188]

69     The Accused eventually conceded that the chat records were comprehensive, at least from 29 April 2017 onwards. [^189] However, he contended that the messages sent between 23 and 29 April 2017 were missing from P8A and P8B.183 To support this claim, the Accused alluded to Exhibit D2-1, which purported to show screenshots of the messages remaining on the Accused’s mobile phone that were supposedly exchanged between the Complainant and Accused from 23 to 29 April 2017. In my view, the Accused’s reliance on Exhibit D2-1 was problematic.

> (a)     Firstly, the messages in Exhibit D2-1 were incomplete. The Accused admitted that he had deleted most of his messages with the Complainant.[^190] As such, the context behind the messages in Exhibit D2-1 could not be discerned. For example, the Accused had relied on the WeChat message captured in Exhibit D2-1, purportedly sent from the Complainant on 24 April 2017, stating: “_I’ll be in Toa Payoh tonight. Only be free after 9_”. The Accused argued that this message, which (according to his timeline of events) was sent the day after the Brotzeit Dinner, showed that the Complainant was satisfied with the Brotzeit Dinner and hoped to meet him again (see paragraph 40 above). Yet, Exhibit D2-1 failed to capture the immediately preceding messages that would have explained what prompted the Complainant to send that message in the first place.

> (b)     Secondly, the Prosecution had specifically raised concerns about the messages in Exhibit D2-1. The Prosecution observed that the messages in Exhibit D2-1 appeared to be selective and could have been taken out of context.[^191] As such, the Prosecution invited the Accused to hand over his mobile phone to the police for a comprehensive extraction of all the messages (including deleted ones) to be attempted.[^192] The Prosecution even offered to complete the process and return the mobile phone to the Accused within two days.[^193] The Prosecution made it clear that if the Accused turned this offer down, the Prosecution would invite the court to place no weight on Exhibit D2-1. Despite this, the Accuse refused to hand his mobile phone over for forensic examination. He cited the following reasons for his refusal:

>> (i)       He could not live without his mobile phone for two days;[^194]

>> (ii)       He used his mobile phone for his work and he owed confidentiality obligations to his company;[^195] and

>> (iii)       As a youth leader of several local and international organisations, he had to interact with clan leaders and members and he did not wish to reveal the private information of any of these persons.[^196]

>> Given the gravity inherent in the outcome of a criminal trial, which the Accused would have well appreciated, I found his reasons for refusing to hand over his phone to border on the frivolous.

70     Finally, even if I had accepted Exhibit D2-1 at face value, I note that the messages therein did not assist the defence. As was the case for Exhibits P8A and P8B, Exhibit D2-1 did not contain any messages of a romantic nature emanating from the Complainant. For that matter, Exhibit D2-1 did not contain any romantic messages from the Accused either.

71     The Accused also relied on the WhatAapp messages exchanged on 2 September 2018, _ie_, the day before the Complainant came to his flat. He had sent her explicit messages, set out at paragraph 15 above, which he claimed would have left no doubt in her mind as to his intentions. He had pointedly sought confirmation that the Complainant’s husband was overseas and asked her if it was fine for her not to return home after visiting his flat. For ease of reference, I reproduce the messages here:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.9%"> <col width="80.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sender</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>WhatsApp message contents</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Let’s chat a little later tomorrow night.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Come to my house to chat okay?</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Complainant</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Oh…</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Great!

The Accused added that when a middle-aged woman goes alone to a middle-aged man’s home in the middle of the night, the implications are unmistakeable - both parties must have sex on their minds.[^197] As such, there was no way for the Complainant to have misunderstood the Accused’s designs. That she still came to his flat willingly proved that she was a willing party to the tryst.

72     However, I note that there is nothing in the chat messages to show that the Complainant had ever reciprocated the Accused’s overtures. For example, when he asked her to come to his house to chat, she did not say “yes” but had instead remarked “oh” and followed up by asking if it was safe to go the Accused’s flat. Clearly, she was expressing reservations. When he asked her if it was fine for her not to go back home on 3 September 2017, she again did not respond to his question directly but posted the emoticon of a shocked face. The Complainant’s messages were thus consistent with her testimony, which was that she simply ignored the Accused’s advances and kept her focus on the business of photography.

#### The Complainant’s testimony about the Incidents

73     I now move on to the Complainant’s testimony as regards what happened in the Accused’s flat.

74     In cases involving sexual offences, an accused person should not be convicted based on the complainant’s testimony alone (without any corroboration), unless that testimony is “unusually convincing”: see _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 26</span>[^198] (“_AOF_”). In _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 48</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that the requirement for the complainant’s testimony to be “unusually convincing” did not entail a change to the criminal standard of proof. Rather it simply meant that the trial judge must be aware of:[^199]

> the importance of convicting only on testimony that, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused.

In _AOF_, the Court of Appeal elaborated further on what the term “unusually convincing” entailed:[^200]

> … it is clear that a witness’s testimony may only be found to be “unusually _convincing_” by weighing the _demeanour_ of the witness alongside both the _internal and external consistencies_ found in the witness’ testimony. \[emphasis in original text\]

75     Having heard the evidence in the present case, I found the Complainant’s testimony to be unusually unconvincing. It was consistent and remained unshaken throughout cross-examination and questions posed by the court. I also found her responses to be spontaneous and candid.

76     Having said that, I am aware that there was one aspect of her evidence that lacked clarity. This pertained to how her bra came undone during the struggle with the Accused on the bed:

> (a)     During the Complainant’s examination-in-chief:

>> (i)       She explained that the Accused had tugged at her bra but she did not know how her bra came unhooked[^201].

>> (ii)       When clarification was sought as to who undid her bra, the she replied that it was the Accused.[^202]

> (b)     During the Complainant’s cross-examination:

>> (i)       She clarified that the bra was not unfastened while it was still on her breast. The bra was nevertheless lifted above her breast as a result of the Accused’s grabbing actions.[^203]

>> (ii)       She further explained that as the bra was loose, it could possibly have come unhooked during the struggle with the Accused, when he was tugging at it. However, she could not confirm whether it was deliberately unhooked by someone or if it came unhooked on its own. Upon coming unhooked, the bra had been lifted up.[^204]

> (c)     During the Complainant’s re-examination, she confirmed that she could not recall how the bra’s hooks got unfastened, as it was in any event a loose bra.[^205]

The Complainant’s testimony was thus not clear as to exactly when her bra came unhooked and whether it was the Accused who had deliberately unhooked it.

77     I was of the view that the lack of clarity in this aspect of the Complainant’s evidence did not vitiate the convincing nature of her testimony. One should not lose sight of the fact that during the struggle, the Complainant was pinned down by the Accused. As he straddled and forced himself upon her, she repeatedly shouted and tried to break free, but to no avail. Under such trying circumstances, it was understandable if she had not been fully cognisant of when and how her bra came unhooked. Furthermore, given that the bra was loose, it would have been difficult for her to pinpoint whether it was the Accused who unhooked the bra or whether it came undone by itself during the struggle. In any event, I note that there was independent evidence to validate the hypothesis that it was the Accused who unhooked the Complainant’s bra. In his statement in Exhibit P21 (extracted at paragraph 90 below), the Accused stated quite plainly that he _did_ try to unhook her bra, before pushing the bra up and squeezing her breasts.

78     Even if I was wrong in concluding that the Complainant’s testimony was unusually convincing, there was yet other evidence to corroborate her claims. The law states that the distress of a victim of a sexual offence, if manifested contemporaneously, can constitute good corroboration of the complaint: see _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 58</span>.[^206]

79     In the present case, there was compelling evidence of the Complainant’s distress, witnessed by multiple parties:

> (a)     During the trial, the Prosecution called two of the police officers who arrived at the scene, PW8 Sergeant John Eric Yeo Jinwei (“Sergeant Yeo”) and W/Insp Ng, as witnesses. They testified as follows:

>> (i)       Sergeant Yeo said that the Complainant was sobbing uncontrollably.[^207]

>> (ii)       W/Insp Ng, who spoke extensively with the Complainant at the foot of the Accused’s block, said that the Complainant was in a state of shock, sobbing and shivering.[^208]

> (b)     Vincent Teo testified that when the Complainant called him to come and look for her, she was “crying or trembling and/or terrified”.[^209] He testified that it sounded like something bad had happened and he even thought that the Complainant was going to do something silly like attempt suicide.[^210] Ultimately, while she did not tell him over the phone exactly what had happened, the fear in her voice was sufficient to send Vincent Teo scurrying over, with wife and child in tow.

80     Yet a further indication of the Complainant’s distress was how she fled down the Accused’s block of flats without even putting her shoes on. She testified that she was anxious to leave the flat quickly and had thus ran to the lift without wearing her shoes.[^211] As seen in the video footage in Exhibit P3-2, the Complainant had stepped out of the lift and onto the void deck barefoot.

81     The Accused sought to refute the notion that the Complainant was in distress.

82     Firstly, the Accused argued that if the Complainant had truly been in distress, she would have called the police[^212] or at least called her husband, [^213] while locked in the bathroom. The fact that she did not reach out to either but called Vincent Teo instead showed that she did not perceive any real danger to herself. However, the Complainant gave the following explanations for her actions:

> (a)     She did not call the police as she did not want to blow matters up; all she wanted to do was go home.[^214] This aspect of the Complainant’s testimony was supported by the evidence of Vincent Teo. Vincent Teo testified that the Complainant had initially refused to tell the police what happened, citing her fears that the matter would be publicized in the newspapers, thereby causing embarrassment to her husband. Vincent Teo testified that he had to reassure her, in the presence of W/Insp Ng, that the police would not publish such matters.[^215] Even then, the Complainant continued to ask if he was sure that her husband would not find out about this matter, as she did not want to embarrass him.[^216]

> (b)     She did not call her husband as she was worried about what he might think as regards her being in another man’s home.[^217]

> (c)     The Complainant explained that she thought to call Vincent Teo because he was the colleague who helped her with her presentation earlier that day[^218] and he was also the one who fetched her to meet the Accused at Bishan CC.[^219]

I was satisfied with these explanations and found that, under the circumstances, it was not unnatural for Vincent Teo to have been the first person who came to the Complainant’s mind when she was reaching out for help.

83     Secondly, the Accused argued that any inference of distress was negated by the fact that, upon coming out of the bathroom, the Complainant had the presence of mind to charge her mobile phone.[^220] However, I note that the Complainant’s mobile phone was the primary means by which she had reached out to Vincent Teo. She had called him for help, only to have her contact with him cut off midstream when her phone battery went flat. Furthermore, it was not as if she had sat down waiting passively for her phone to charge. She took the opportunity to look for the keys to the flat, to make her escape, while her phone was charging. The Complainant had also tried to confine the Accused in his room, by tying the doorknob to the chair with an electrical cable, while she charged her phone and looked for the flat keys. I thus did not think that the Complainant’s actions after she emerged from her bathroom, _ie_ charging her mobile phone and looking for the flat keys, were inconsistent with the fear and distress which she claimed to have experienced at the time.

84     Thirdly, the Accused argued that the measures adopted by the Complainant, supposedly to protect herself, were ridiculously inefficacious. This, according to the Accused, tended to support the inference that she was never in any real state of panic. For example:

> (a)     The pair of scissors that the Complainant had taken from his bathroom, purportedly to defend herself, could not possibly have been used for self-defence. It was very small and had rounded tips and was meant for clipping nasal hairs. If the Complainant had truly been intent on defending herself, she would have gone to the kitchen to get a knife.[^221]

> (b)     The Complainant had purportedly tried to confine the Accused in the master bedroom by tying the bedroom doorknob to the chair with the electrical cable. This was clearly ineffective, as the electrical cable was thick and smooth and would not have been able to bind a rounded doorknob[^222] – the ineffectiveness of this measure was clearly seen in how the cable simply dropped off when the Accused emerged from the master bedroom. Further, given that the master bedroom doorframe was much wider than the dimensions of the chair, someone inside the master bedroom could still open the door (which opened inwards) quite easily as the chair (assuming that it remained bound to the doorknob) would have simply been dragged into the master bedroom.[^223]

> (c)     If the Complainant had truly been intent on making an effective getaway, she would have locked the flat’s gate before running off to the lift, so as to slow the Accused down should he pursue her. Yet, she failed to do this.[^224]

I was of the view that it was not realistic to nit-pick, with the benefit of hindsight, on what the Complainant could have done better to protect herself. Her actions had to be viewed through the lens of someone who had just been attacked by the Accused and who was urgently looking for a way to extricate herself from his flat. While the scissors that she took may not have been particularly lethal, she had reached for it while locked in the bathroom – there was no evidence of any more effective weapon inside the bathroom which she could have laid her hands on. As regards the tying of the doorknob to the chair, the Accused admitted that the Complainant _did_ do this. What conceivable reason would she have for going through this rigmarole, if there had indeed been no cause for fear or panic? As regards the fact that the Complainant ran out of the flat without attempting to lock the gate, she explained that this was because she wanted to leave in the shortest possible time[^225] −that sounded eminently sensible.

85     Fourthly, the Accused suggested that the Complainant, in stepping out of the lift onto the void deck without her shoes, might have been putting on an act for the camera.[^226] However, there was no evidence that the Complainant was even aware of the police camera at the void deck, let alone that she deliberately took her shoes off in order to feign fear and distress.

86     Having carefully evaluated the Complainant’s testimony, coupled with the surrounding evidence adduced by the Prosecution, I was satisfied that the charges had been proven against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

87     I should also add that the Accused had, at various junctures of the proceedings, tried to compel the Prosecution to disclose the Complainant’s police statement (which application was resisted by the Prosecution). I asked the Prosecution whether it had complied with its disclosure obligations under _Muhammad bin Kadar & anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 32</span> (“_Kadar_”). The Prosecution confirmed that it had faithfully complied with its _Kadar_ obligations and that there was nothing on the evidence adduced which would have necessitated disclosure of the Complainant’s police statement.[^227] I then turned to the Accused and told him that witness statements are generally inadmissible under s 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”). In doing so, I was aware that in _Tay Wee Kiat & anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 42</span>, the High Court had provided some guidance[^228] on the circumstances under which disclosure pursuant to s 259 of the CPC might be ordered. I thus explained to the Accused that he could still make an application for disclosure of the Complainant’s police statement if, for example, he could point to some material discrepancy in her testimony, on which her statement could potentially cast some light (this being an explanation couched in rather lay terms, given that the Accused was unrepresented).

88     The Accused said that he was sure the Complainant’s statement would reveal at least 10 discrepancies in her testimony.[^229] However, despite being given repeated opportunities to explain, the Accused was not able to point to a single discrepancy that would have remotely supported his request for the Complainant’s statement.[^230] In the end, the Accused had this to say:[^231]

> Your Honour, I have never seen that statement. I can only assess based on what \[the Complainant\] ---how \[the Complainant\] had presented in Court. I feel that she is a totally dishonest person. **_So, I am speculating that her statement---her statements would differ from time to time_**. \[emphasis added\]

It was thus clear from the Accused’s response (that he was speculating) that his application for disclosure of the Complainant’s statement was nothing more than a fishing expedition. I rejected it accordingly.

#### The Accused’s testimony about the Incidents

89     As regards the Accused’s testimony, I found his account of what transpired in his flat to be implausible. According to him, the Complainant had been receptive to his touches. She displayed only very mild resistance to his advances, telling him “don’t play” in what he called a “melodious voice”.[^232] Yet, in the very next instance, she locked herself in the bathroom for over an hour, where she cried and pleaded for her friend to come and rescue her. What could possibly have accounted for such a drastic turnabout in her emotional state?

90     I also noted that the Accused’s testimony was inconsistent in highly material respects, particularly when compared with his statement to the police in Exhibit P21. As regards the events occurring in the Accused’s flat, the relevant portion of the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P21 is paragraph 9, which is set out below:

> When she entered the master bedroom, she sat down at the corner of my bed. I then sat down next to her. I then asked her to sit against the bed’s head rest as I had switched on the television and played a music DVD. She then rested her against the head rest. I sat on her left. I then placed my hand across her shoulders and she did not say anything. She then talked about her life goals and her products. She then asked me to take photographs of her products. I then suggested that I should take the photographs with her holding them and she still told me to make her look prettier in the photographs. **_She also looked at me with sultry eyes. Shortly after, I kissed her 2-3 times on her cheek and ears and she told me in Mandarin “don’t play”. She then fell over the bed._** **_I then went on top of her and I used my hand to touch her breasts underneath her bra. I lifted up her blouse and tried to unhook her bra. I pushed the bra up and squeezed her breasts. She then pushed me away and said “don’t play” in Mandarin_**. **_I then rolled over_**. She went out to the common toilet and closed the door. … \[emphasis added\]

91     The statement thus blended with the Accused’s testimony in court, to the extent that it sought to depict the Complainant as a willing participant who had a sudden and inexplicable change of heart. However, there were material discrepancies between paragraph 9 of the statement (extracted immediately above) and the Accused’s oral testimony, as regards the following key details:

> (a)     According to the Accused’s oral testimony, he _did not try to unhook the Accused’s bra_.[^233] All he did was to reach into her blouse and, _as his hand reached the upper part of her breast_, she pushed him away.[^234] I also note that the Accused had put across a different version of facts when he was cross-examining the Complainant – he suggested that his hand had gone under the Complainant’s blouse and was _almost reaching_ her breast when she pushed him away.[^235] Regardless of which version was true, both versions ran counter to paragraph 9 of his statement in Exhibit P21. Paragraph 9 clearly stated that the Accused _did_ try to unhook the Complainant’s bra. Furthermore, rather than merely reaching the upper part of the Complainant’s breast, the statement said that the Accused’s hand had _pushed the bra up_ and _squeezed_ the Complainant’s breasts, before she pushed him away.

> (b)     In his oral evidence, the Accused disagreed with the Complainant’s claim that he straddled her, denying that he had even gone top of her.[^236] Yet, paragraph 9 of his statement in Exhibit P21 stated that he _went on top of_ the Complainant and, after squeezing her breasts, _rolled off_.

These shifting versions cast grave doubts on the truth of the Accused’s account of what actually happened.

92     The Accused sought to challenge the accuracy of his statement (although he made it clear that he was not raising any issue of voluntariness[^237]). Specifically, the Accused levelled the following allegations against the statement recorder, ASP Lee:

> (a)     ASP Lee recorded the statement in Exhibit P21 hurriedly.[^238] In all, the statement was recorded over a duration of only one hour 45 minutes. Even then, time was spent by ASP Lee chatting with the Accused and breaking the ice.[^239] Despite having to take time to type the statement,[^240] ASP Lee still took breaks to smoke at least two cigarettes.[^241] Time was also spent by ASP Lee making amendments, printing the statement and reading it back to the Accused.[^242] As such, one hour 45 minutes was definitely insufficient.[^243]

> (b)     ASP Lee had also fabricated key parts of the statement in Exhibit P21. The fabricated parts included the following:

>> (i)       The portion at paragraph 3 (extracted at paragraph 60 above), which stated that the Accused ceased communications with the Complainant after the Brotzeit Dinner as he did not like her to keep asking him to join her business.[^244]

>> (ii)       Various portions of paragraph 9 (extracted at paragraph 90 above), which recounted what happened in the master bedroom, including the parts stating that the Accused had tried to unhook the Complainant’s bra[^245] and that he went on top of her.[^246]

>> The Accused said that ASP Lee was able to insert these fabrications by taking advantage of the Accused’s weak command of English.[^247] To that end, ASP Lee refused to engage a Mandarin interpreter despite the Accused asking for one.[^248]

> (c)     The Accused also contended that ASP Lee deliberately misspelt the Complainant’s name, which appeared on every page of the statement in Exhibit P21. This was to induce the Accused to correct these obvious errors, thereby painting the impression that the Accused had the occasion to correct errors on every page of the statement.[^249]

> (d)     The statement in Exhibit P21 also omitted to mention specific matters which the Accused had raised to ASP Lee. For example, he had informed ASP Lee that while he and the Complainant were sitting in the living room, the Accused had touched her waist and thighs and her breasts had come close to his elbows. Yet, none of this was recorded.[^250]

> (e)     ASP Lee also failed to read the entire statement to the Accused. Instead, he only read out portions of the statement.[^251]

Looking back, the Accused opined that he had been too trusting of ASP Lee during the statement recording process.[^252]

93     When ASP Lee was first called to the stand during the Prosecution’s case, none of the above allegations were put to him. These allegations were raised by the Accused only after the defence was called, when the Prosecution adduced Exhibit P21 to impeach him during his cross-examination. As such, the Prosecution had to recall ASP Lee as a witness, to rebut the above allegations.

94     Upon his recall, ASP Lee testified as follows:

> (a)     The statement was recorded at the Accused’s own pace,[^253] without ASP Lee rushing the process.[^254] As regards the allegation that ASP had taken breaks during the interview to smoke, ASP Lee testified that he did not smoke and that, in any event, officers are not allowed to smoke within the police station.[^255]

> (b)     ASP Lee had recorded the statement according to what the Accused had said. ASP Lee did not fabricate paragraphs 3[^256] or 9[^257] of the statement.

> (c)     The Accused did not make any request for an interpreter. If such a request had been made, ASP Lee would have arranged for an interpreter to be present.[^258]

> (d)     ASP Lee did not deliberately misspell the Complainant’s name in the statement. The misspelling was a genuine mistake on ASP Lee’s part.[^259]

> (e)     ASP Lee did not omit to include any of the matters raised by the Accused during the recording of the statement.[^260]

> (f)     ASP Lee had run through the entire statement with the Accused, line by line.[^261]

95     Having heard the evidence of both the Accused and ASP Lee, I preferred the evidence of ASP Lee and rejected the Accused’s challenge to the accuracy of his statement in Exhibit P21. In particular:

> (a)     One hour and 45 minutes was by no means a short time to record a four-page statement. This was a poor excuse by the Accused to explain his failure to raise critical points of his defence in the statement.

> (b)     As regards the alleged fabrications that ASP Lee inserted, I noted that they pertained to details within Exhibit P21 that set out the backdrop to the general thrust of the Accused’s defence (being that he did not force himself on the Complainant). Ultimately, these details damaged the Accused’s case _not_ because they were incriminating in and of themselves but because the Accused had, in his oral testimony, painted a defence containing specifics that contradicted these details (which contradictions he could not explain). If ASP Lee had indeed wanted to fabricate the statement, it was hard to see why he would have chosen to fabricate details of such a neutral nature.

> (c)     I also rejected the Accused’s claim that his lack of proficiency in the English language prevented him from detecting the alleged inaccuracies in the statement. I observed that the sentence in A5 of the statement initially stated, erroneously, that the Accused _did not_ have condoms in his home. Yet, the Accused was able to spot this error and rectify it so that the sentence correctly reflected that he _did_ have condoms in his home.[^262] Clearly, the Accused was well capable of reading the statement and catching technical errors with his own eyes.

As such, I concluded that the Accused’s allegations against ASP Lee were mere afterthoughts and that the statement in Exhibit P21 had been properly recorded.

#### The Accused’s claim that he was framed

96     In trials for sexual offences, where an accused person raises sufficient evidence of a _motive_ by the complainant to fabricate the allegations, thereby raising a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case, the burden lies on the Prosecution to prove the _absence_ of any such motive: see _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 125</span>.[^263] In the present case, the Accused claimed that the Complainant fabricated the allegations him. In the Accused’s words, the Complainant: [^264]

> .. was forced to give a false statement and she was forced to lie and to patch up a lie repeatedly.

On the facts, I was unable to discern any conceivable motive for the Complainant to fabricate the allegations against the Accused.

97     In the Accused’s statement to the police in Exhibit P21, he suggested (at paragraph A10 of the statement) that the Complainant may have made false accusations in order to extort money from him:

> I believe that \[the Complainant\] may have wanted to extort money from me earlier when she was in the bathroom but I did not offer any monetary compensation then. I also believe that her male friend had influenced her to call the police.

However, during the trial, the Accused agreed that he never received any offers to settle the Complainant’s complaint in exchange for pecuniary consideration.[^265] He eventually conceded that the possibility of her framing him for financial gain was “very very low”.[^266]

98     The Accused also suggested that Vincent Teo instigated the Complainant to frame him. The Accused noted that the Complainant had locked herself in the bathroom for over an hour.[^267] While inside, she communicated with Vincent Teo over her mobile phone. Thereafter, the Accused heard the voice of a man coming from within his flat. The Accused testified that he was _certain_ that the man was Vincent Teo.[^268] He hypothesised that Vincent Teo, while in the flat, must have instigated the Complainant to frame the Accused.[^269]

99     It was difficult to see why Vincent Teo would frame the Accused, given that both men did not know each other prior to the Incidents.[^270] Nevertheless, given the Accused’s conspiracy theory, the Prosecution extended to the Accused the logs of all messages (whether on the WeChat, WhatsApp or SMS platform) that fell within the following parameters:

> (a)     Messages between the Complainant and **Vincent Teo**, for the _six-day_ span commencing three days before 3 September 2017 and ending three days after.[^271]

> (b)     Messages between the Complainant and **anyone else**, for the _five-hour_ span commencing at 8pm on 3 September 2017 and ending at 12.45am on 4 September 2017.[^272]

100    Upon perusing the message logs that were furnished to him, the Accused homed in on messages that had been exchanged between the Complainant and Vincent Teo in the early morning hours of 3 September 2017 (_ie_, the day of the Incidents). The exchange of messages, which was adduced by the Accused as Exhibit D5, is set out below:

The Accused suggested that this exchange showed that Vincent Teo had amorous designs on the Complainant.[^273] Presumably, if Vincent Teo and the Complainant had indeed been in a relationship, he would have been unhappy with the Accused for having an affair with the Complainant. This would then constitute a motive for Vincent Teo to get the Accused into trouble. Vincent Teo, on his part, denied that he was flirting with the Complainant in the messages above.[^274] He also confirmed that he was not in any romantic relationship with the Complainant.[^275]

101    Regardless of whether one regarded the message exchange between Vincent Teo and the Complainant as flirting, I did not find the messages to go so far as to prove that Vincent Teo and the Complainant were in a romantic relationship. In any case, even if they were, it was quite another thing to say that Vincent Teo had engineered a false report to the police to frame the Accused. The suggestion that Vincent Teo was driven by such a cold and calculated motive is also contradicted by the four voice clips, set out at paragraph 27 above, which he sent to the Complainant while she was locked in the bathroom. When played in court, these clips revealed the voice of a man who was worried and concerned for the safety of his friend. Finally, even if Vincent Teo had been wont to fabricate false allegations, the Accused failed to demonstrate why the Complainant would join Vincent Teo in that malicious endeavour. The Accused testified that no ill feelings existed between him and the Complainant and that, up to the Incidents, there was “only happiness” between them.[^276]

102    Ultimately, I could discern of no motive for the Complainant to fabricate her allegations. The Accused said that upon perusing the chat logs that I had directed the Prosecution to furnish him (alluded to at paragraph 99(b) above), he noticed that the Complainant had chatted with different men in the night.[^277] He thus wanted to question her about her calls with these men, to see if they might have been in the same situation as Accused.[^278] I failed to see how this line of questioning was in any way relevant to the issue of possible motive by the Complainant (or to any other issue in this case, for that matter) and disallowed his questions.

103    Finally, the Accused suggested that W/Insp Ng may have pressured the Complainant to falsely implicate the Accused, by putting stress on the Complainant and misleading her.[^279] The Accused reasoned that when the Complainant first met Vincent Teo and the male police officer, she said that nothing happened. However, after speaking with W/Insp Ng, the Complainant changed her tune and implicated the Accused. However, I noted the following:

> (a)     Firstly, the Complainant explained clearly in her testimony that she felt awkward about speaking to male officers about being sexually assaulted.[^280] It was thus understandable that she finally opened up only when speaking to a female police officer.

> (b)     Secondly, the Accused had offered no reason for why W/Insp Ng would have wanted to pressure a complainant whom she had just met for the first time to falsely implicate an accused person whom W/Insp Ng had never met before.

> (c)     Thirdly, the allegations against W/Insp Ng were serious and, at the very least, ought to have been raised to her in cross-examination. However, the Accused failed to do this.

As such, I rejected the Accused’s suggestion that W/Insp Ng pressured the Complainant to frame the Accused.

#### Other physical evidence

104    The Accused highlighted that his DNA could _not_ be positively identified on the Complainant’s bra.[^281] This, in the Accused’s view, tended to detract from the Complainant’s testimony that a struggle had taken place. In particular, the DNA expert called by the Prosecution, PW6 Lee Yong Sheng, testified that a _rough_ touch has a higher chance of leaving more DNA.[^282]

105    I did not think that the absence of DNA on the Complainant’s bra and stockings necessarily pointed to the absence of a struggle. Lee Yong Sheng had testified that the existence of DNA traces depends on a host of variables, including how well a person sheds his cells.[^283] In any case, even if one accepts that absence of the Accused’s DNA on the bra and stockings meant that there was no rough handling of these items by the Accused, it was undisputed that his DNA _was_ found on the Complainant’s blouse and skirt.

106    The Accused also highlighted that the Complainant’s clothing had not been damaged. Specifically:

> (a)     the blouse still had all its buttons;[^284]

> (b)     the bra still had all it hooks;[^285]

> (c)     the skirt was not damaged;[^286] and

> (d)     the stockings had no tears on them.[^287]

This, argued the Accused, was consistent with him not having used any force on the Complainant.[^288]

107    Again, I did not see how the absence of damage to the above items furthered the Accused’s claim that no force was used:

> (a)     As regards the blouse, it was never the Complainant’s evidence that the Accused damaged it. Rather, she said that the Accused had simply put his hand underneath her blouse and reached upwards. There is no reason why this should have necessarily damaged the blouse’s buttons.

> (b)     As regards the bra, the Complainant had explained that it was loose – it was thus possible for the bra to come off without any damage to its hooks.

> (c)     As regards the skirt and stockings, there was nothing in the Complainant’s testimony suggesting that the Accused did anything that would have engendered a tear to these items. The absence of damage to these items was thus neither here nor there.

#### Conclusion on Guilt

108    In light of the Complainant’s convincing testimony, the corroborating impact of her contemporaneous distress (as witnessed by multiple witnesses, including the police), the implausible nature of the Accused’s defence, the contradictions in his evidence and the absence of any motive by the Complainant to fabricate her allegations, I found that the Prosecution had proven both charges against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

109    The Accused was thus found guilty of both charges and convicted accordingly.

## The Sentence

110    The Accused was untraced.

111    Before embarking on his mitigation plea, the Accused continued to maintain his innocence and his allegation that the Complainant framed him. He even changed his mind about his mobile phone and offered to surrender the device to the police for forensic examination. I had to remind the Accused repeatedly that I had already issued my pronouncement on liability and that he should focus on mitigating his sentence.

#### The mitigation plea

112    The Accused raised his contributions as a youth leader of a number of Chinese clans. In that capacity, he had worked closely with and planned activities for the youth community.[^289]

113    The Accused also alluded to his family circumstances and the hardships they would face from his punishment. Specifically:

> (a)     The Accused had been supporting four elderly persons who suffered from various ailments, including his deceased mother (who died from intestinal cancer), his father (who suffered from pancreatic ailments), his mother-in-law (who had orthopaedic issues with her kneecap) and his father-in-law (whose right leg had been amputated because of diabetes).[^290]

> (b)     His 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter were still in primary school[^291] and his wife would not be able to single-handedly support the family.[^292] It was precisely because of his financial circumstances that the Accused elected not to engage a lawyer and conduct his defence on his own.[^293]

> (c)     The Accused is a Singapore permanent resident and this case will adversely affect his ability to apply for citizenship.[^294] This would in turn have an impact on whether his children can grow up in a conducive family environment.[^295]

> (d)     As a result of this case, the Accused had to terminate his MBA studies.[^296]

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

114    The Prosecution, on its part, sought a global sentence of at least 5½ years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, comprising:

> (a)     at least 5½ years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the s 354A charge; and

> (b)     at least five months’ imprisonment for the s 354 charge,

with the imprisonment terms for both charges to run concurrently.

115    As regards the s 354A charge, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v. BDA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 72</span> (“_BDA_”), where Foo Chee Hock JC laid out a sentencing framework for s 354A of the Penal Code, under which the indicative starting sentence would fall within one of the following three bands:

> (a)     Band 1: two to four years’ imprisonment, three strokes of the cane;

> (b)     Band 2: four to seven years’ imprisonment, six strokes of the cane; and

> (c)     Band 3: seven to 10 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane.

116    The Prosecution argued that the present case fell within Band 2,[^297] due to the following **offence**\-specific aggravating factors:

> (a)     As regards the degree of sexual exploitation, there was skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s private parts, _ie_, her breasts. The Prosecution argued that this was sufficient in and of itself to bring the imprisonment term to the higher end of Band 2.[^298] Furthermore, the Accused had caused the Complainant pain when he squeezed her breasts.

> (b)     The Accused had used deception in committing the offences. Specifically:

>> (i)       He lured the Complainant to his flat by telling her that he would send her home, only to tell her midway through the journey that he would send her to the venue where he stored his photography equipment and artwork.[^299]

>> (ii)       In his flat, he lured the Complainant into the master bedroom by deceiving her yet again, telling her that his artwork and equipment were in the master bedroom.[^300]

> (c)     The deception practised by the Accused also showed that his actions were premeditated, which was a separate aggravating factor in itself. The Accused had demonstrated commitment to breaking the law and therefore showed greater criminality.[^301]

117    As regards the **offender**\-specific aggravating factors, the Prosecution highlighted the following:

> (a)     The Accused demonstrated lack of remorse. He did not spare the Complainant the ordeal of testifying, making her tell her story and thereby relive the pain of the Incidents.[^302] He also ran a victim-shaming campaign by casting aspersions on her during the trial process. He accused her of fabricating her allegations and suggested that she was in an extramarital relationship with him. He insinuated that she had tempted him in the living room by touching him with her breasts and thigh. [^303]

> (b)     The Accused made spurious allegations against Vincent Teo and several police officers.[^304] He also cast baseless aspersions against the Prosecution, saying that the prosecutor was playing word games when cross-examining the Accused and was more interested in winning the case than exploring the facts.[^305]

> (c)     The Accused also dragged out the trial by conducting his defence in an extravagant manner. For example, he posed a host of irrelevant questions to the Complainant, asking her about her immigration status, the status of her application for permanent residency, her wedding anniversary date, the venue of her first date with her husband, her plans to have children, the background image on her mobile phone, her relationship with her boss and the kind of men that she liked.[^306] He also tried to make submissions during the course of evidence-taking, despite being repeatedly told by the court that he should refrain from doing so.[^307] He also kept trying to seek the court’s help in formulating his trial strategy, despite being told by the court that this was inappropriate.[^308]

118    As regards the s 354 charge, the Prosecution relied on the sentencing framework laid out by Chan Seng Onn J out in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 9</span>[^309] (“_Kunasekaran_”), under which the indicative starting sentence for an offence under s 354 of the Penal Code would fall within one of the following three bands:

> (a)     Band 1: less than five months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Band 2: five to 15 months’ imprisonment; and

> (c)     Band 3: 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

The Prosecution argued that the Accused’s act of hugging the Complainant fell within the lower end of Band 2, as the offence-specific and offender-specific factors raised above in respect of the s 354A charge were similarly applicable to the s 354 charge.[^310] Furthermore, the Accused held the Complainant so tightly that she could feel his erect penis jutting against her through their clothing. An appropriate sentence, argued the Prosecution, would therefore be five months’ imprisonment. [^311]

119    The Prosecution also agreed that the imprisonment terms for both charges could run concurrently, under the one transaction rule. [^312]

#### Decision on the appropriate sentence

120    As regards the s 354A charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that sentencing in this case is governed by the framework laid down by Foo JC in _BDA_. In that case, Foo JC held[^313] that the indicating starting sentence for offences under s 354A of the Penal Code would fall within one of three bands:

> (a)     Band 1: two to four years’ imprisonment, three strokes;

> (b)     Band 2: four to seven years’ imprisonment, six strokes; and

> (c)     Band 3: seven to 10 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes.

In determining the appropriate band, the court would have regard to the offence-specific aggravating factors at play.

121    In setting out the sentencing framework above, Foo JC took guidance from the judgment of See Kee Oon J in _GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> (“_GBR_”). In _GBR_, See J similarly laid out a three-band sentencing framework for s 354(2) of the Penal Code (outrage of modesty of victims under 14 years of age). In doing so, See J explained the considerations that would impact on which band was most appropriate:

> 32    Band 1 comprises cases at the lowest end of the spectrum of seriousness. These would include those which do not present any (or at most one) of the aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts. Caning is generally not imposed for this category of cases, although the possibility of caning is not excluded altogether; this depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. …

> 33 Where two or more of the aggravating factors present themselves, the case will almost invariably fall within Band 2. Caning will nearly always be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least three strokes of the cane…. At the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim, for example, if the touching occurred over the victim’s clothes. …

> 34    At the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases would be those involving the skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs. In the third charge in ABO, for example, the accused rubbed his exposed and erect penis against the victim’s vagina.

> …

> 37    Band 3 cases are those which, by reason of the number of the aggravating factors, present themselves as the most serious instances of aggravated outrage of modesty. Caning ought to be imposed, and the suggested starting point would be at least six strokes of the cane. These would include cases such as those involving the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.

122    While the _number_ of offence-specific aggravating factors present in the case has a determinative impact on the appropriate band, certain offence-specific factors may carry more heft in tipping the scales. As held in paragraph 34 of the _GBR_ judgment extracted immediately above, skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts or sexual organs will push the case up to the _higher end_ of the Band 2 spectrum. While this statement in _GBR_ was made in the context of offences under s 354(2) of the Penal Code, it was specifically endorsed by Foo JC in _BDA_[^314] in the s 354A context. The sentencing framework laid down in _BDA_ was subsequently adopted in the case of _Public Prosecutor v BSR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 64</span> (“_BSR_”), where Chan Seng Onn J also endorsed[^315] the statement in _GBR_ (that cases involving skin-to-skin touching of the victim’s private parts would fall at the higher end of the Band 2 spectrum) in the s 354A context.

123    Reverting to the instant case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s actions fell within Band 2 of the _BDA_ framework, thereby attracting an indicative starting sentence of between four to seven years’ imprisonment plus six strokes of the cane. In arriving at this conclusion, I took account of the nature of the sexual exploitation, _ie_,

> (a)     There was skin-to-skin contact with the Complainant’s breasts; and

> (b)     The Accused inflicted pain on the Complainant when he squeezed her breasts.

124    The pertinent question then pertains to where, within the Band 2 spectrum, the Accused’s sentence ought to be pegged. In scanning the precedents, I noted some relatively recent cases involving s 354A of the Penal Code where the High Court imposed sentences that were much lighter than what the Prosecution sought in the present case, despite the presence of offence-specific aggravating factors that were more grave than that before me. For example:

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v. Lee Ah Choy_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 154</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, one charge under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code. He also faced other charges, including that for rape and criminal intimidation of the victim. As regards the s 354A(2)(b) charge, the degree of sexual exploitation was particularly aggravating, as the offender had digitally penetrated the victim’s vagina. The victim was also vulnerable, being only 12 years of age. The High Court sentenced the offender to four years’ imprisonment plus six strokes of the cane for the charge under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code, _ie_, lower than what the Prosecution sought against the Accused in the present case.

> (b)     In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Choon Beng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 169</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, one charge under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code. He also faced other charges, including rape, forced fellatio and digital penetration of the victim. As regards the charge under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code, the facts were similarly of an aggravated nature. The accused had accosted the victim (who was a total stranger to him) on the street, grabbed her buttocks and pushed her to the ground. He sat on top of her, thereby restraining her. He also threatened to hit her. He then pulled apart her blouse and yanked her bra down, before grabbing and kissing her breast. He also tore off her panties. For this charge, the High Court sentenced the offender to 2½ years’ imprisonment plus four strokes of the cane.

125    However, both these cases were decided _before_ Foo JC’s decision in _BDA_. When Foo JC laid out the sentencing framework in _BDA_, he explicitly held[^316] that the framework was to apply _prospectively_. It appears that the watermark for sentences in s 354A cases has risen, ever since _BDA_:

> (a)     In _BDA_ itself, Foo JC imposed a sentence of five years’ imprisonment plus six strokes of the cane for what he felt was a Band 2 case. It is noteworthy that Foo JC was of the view that based on the sentencing framework that he was laying down, an appropriate term of imprisonment would have been _six years_.307 Nevertheless, Foo JC refrained from imposing this as it significantly exceeded the sentences that the courts had been meting out for s 354A cases up to that point (which clustered around 30 months’ imprisonment). Foo JC thus felt that the principle of prospective overruling mitigated against applying the new sentencing framework, with full force, to the offender in _BDA_.307

> (b)     The sentencing framework in _BDA_ was adopted in the subsequent case of _BSR_, where Chan J similarly regarded the case before him as falling under Band 2. Chan J imposed an imprisonment term of 5½ years, plus six strokes of the cane. It is worth noting that unlike in _BDA_ (where the offender claimed trial) the offender in _BSR pleaded guilty_. It is thus conceivable that if the offender had claimed trial, the sentence could have easily reached the six-year mark.

From the above, one sees that an offender who is convicted _after trial_ for an offence under s 354A of the Penal Code can expect an imprisonment term of at least six years (in addition to caning), if the case falls under **Band 2** and the offence-specific factors bear _similar gravity_ to that in _BDA_ or _BSR_.

126    On this note, I observed that the offence-specific factors in _BDA_ and _BSR_ were highly aggravating:

> (a)     In _BDA_, the offender had committed a number of sexual offences against the victim, including rape. The degree of sexual exploitation for the charge under s 354A of the Penal Code was high - the offender had sucked on the victim’s breasts while restraining her. There was also severe abuse of trust, as the victim was the offender’s biological mother.

> (b)     In _BSR_, the offender had committed a number of sexual offences against more than one victim. In respect of the charge under s 354A of the Penal Code, the degree of sexual exploitation was high – the offender had squeezed the victim’s breast and licked her nipples while pinning her down on the bed. He also placed a pillow over her face until she stopped screaming. There was abuse of trust, as the victim was the offender’s niece. Furthermore, she was vulnerable, being only 13 years of age.

If the offence-specific factors in both these cases would have attracted an imprisonment term in the region of six years (on the premise that the offender claims trial), I was of the view that the imprisonment term in the present case should be pegged at _under_ five years. Many of the aggravating factors in _BDA_ and _BSR_ were absent here. Furthermore, the Accused in the present case had not followed through entirely with his criminal conduct. He had kissed the Complainant’s breasts and was about to reach her nipples, when her screams peaked in volume. This made him stop and get up. In contrast, the criminal conduct in both _BDA_ and _BSR_ were of a much more persistent nature.

127    The Prosecution contended that there were still offence-specific aggravating factors in the present case that justified sliding the sentence upwards along the Band 2 scale. Specifically, the Accused had used deception to lure the Complainant to his flat and subsequently into his bedroom. This, argued the Prosecution, also showed pre-meditation on the Accused’s part.

128    It is true that the use of deception can be a separate aggravating factor. In _GBR_, See J held:[^317]

> The use of deception by the accused is also a relevant aggravating factor which would bring a case to the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases.

However, I would think that the _purpose_ of the deception is pivotal. I am prepared to accept that the Accused did deceive the Complainant, by telling her that his artwork and photography equipment were in his flat. I am prepared to go so far as to accept that he had deceived her with a view to getting her alone with him in his flat. However, on the facts, I could not say for sure whether he had steered her into being alone with him because:

> (a)     he harboured the misguided hope that this would engender the mood for consensual physical intimacy, or

> (b)     this was part of a pre-meditated plan to sexually violate her against her will once she was isolated.

If it had been the former and the Accused developed the intention to sexually assault the Complainant only after they were alone together, the deception could not be regarded as having been practised to facilitate the offence. As the facts do not conclusively point either way, I gave the Accused the benefit of the doubt and declined to exclude the possibility that the motivation for his deception was in fact the former rather than the latter. In that respect, I note that a day before the offences, the Accused had given the Complainant an inkling of what he had in mind. Specifically, he asked her if it was fine for her not to go home after coming to the Accused’s flat, given that her husband was overseas (see the messages extracted at paragraph 15 above). The Complainant had ignored these lurid messages, as she was perfectly entitled to, and focused on the business of photography. Nevertheless, the Accused’s act of sending such explicit signals on the very night before the Incidents was incongruent with the actions of someone using deception to keep a victim in an unsuspecting state so that he could lure her into a trap.

129    For the same reasons, I did not think that there were sufficient grounds for concluding that the Accused’s attack was premeditated.

130    Next, I move to the offender-specific factors relating to the s 354A charge.

131    The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had conducted his defence in an extravagant manner, pursuing irrelevant lines of questioning and unnecessarily protracting the trial. However, I decided not to place too much weight on this, given the Accused’s lack of familiarity with the legal process. I stress at the outset that just because an accused person is unrepresented, this is no licence for him to abuse the judicial process by wasting the court’s time pursuing one red herring after another. I had thus looked carefully at the Notes of Evidence to see how the Accused conducted his defence. I sought to examine whether it was really a case of him deliberately embarking on frivolous tactics to stretch the proceedings, or whether his irrelevant lines of questioning arose from a poor grasp of the legal process and a genuine inability to apply the test of relevance. I noted that there were a number of instances where I had explained to the Accused that his queries to the witness were irrelevant, upon which he immediately desisted from pursuing the line of questioning. As such, I decided to give the Accused the benefit of the doubt in this regard and declined to treat him as having deliberately protracted the trial.

132    Nevertheless, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had conducted his defence in a manner that showed blatant lack of remorse. The Prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v BNO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 243</span>, where the offender was charged with one count of outraging the modesty of, as well as two counts of fellating, the victim (who was a minor). In sentencing the offender, See Kee Oon J held:

> 194    In addressing the offender-specific aggravating factors, the primary consideration was the Accused’s lack of remorse. The Court of Appeal in _Terence Ng_ explained that an offender’s evident lack of remorse can be discerned from the fact that he has made scandalous allegations in respect of the Complainant. In the present case, the Accused had similarly displayed a marked lack of remorse. First, he claimed trial to the offences: _Terence Ng_ at \[64(c)\]. He did not spare the Complainant the ordeal of testifying. The Complainant had to tell his story yet again and relive the painful details of the incident while testifying in court. In _Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 68</span>, the court recognised at \[46\] that victims of sexual offences are made to relive the trauma of their sexual assault when they have to attend court to give evidence and be cross-examined on it. …

> 195    Second, the Accused’s lack of remorse was apparent from the bold and extravagant manner in which he chose to conduct his defence. He engaged in victim-shaming tactics to portray the Complainant as a hyper-sexualised boy who had fabricated or imagined the sexual acts due to his alleged “familiarity with sexual matters”. He made numerous spurious allegations in a bid to discredit the Complainant.

133    In the present case, the Accused had levelled baseless allegations against a host of innocent parties, as detailed below:

> (a)     As regards the Complainant, the Accused had alleged in his police statement that she was trying to frame him for pecuniary gain. After abandoning that claim in court, he went on to allege that she was having an affair with him and had allowed herself to be coaxed by third parties with ulterior motives into fabricating allegations against him. This was found to be baseless. During the court proceedings, the Complainant broke down several times while recounting what happened in the Accused’s flat. However, the Accused listed out her actions in court (_eg_, crying, requesting for tissue to wipe her tears, requesting for water, seeking breaks from the stand when she broke down) and cynically portrayed them as distractions engineered by the Complainant to give herself space to fabricate further falsehoods to patch her earlier lies.[^318] This was yet another unwarranted attack by the Accused against the Complainant.

> (b)     As regards Vincent Teo, the Accused alleged that he was romantically involved with the Complainant and had pressed her into framing the Accused. Yet, the Accused could produce no compelling evidence to substantiate this.

> (c)     As regards the police officers, the Accused alleged that W/Insp Ng pressured and misled the Complainant into framing the Accused, while ASP Lee fabricated portions of the Accused’s statement in Exhibit P21. These were spurious allegations – both officers were merely doing their jobs.

> (d)     As regards the Prosecution, the Accused alleged that the prosecutor had engaged in word games when cross-examining him and was not interested in the facts. Having sat through the cross-examination of the Accused, I found this allegation to be without merit.

The Accused had thus sprayed scandalous accusations indiscriminately, in every conceivable direction. This was clearly an aggravating factor.

134    I had concluded at paragraph 126 above that, based on the offence-specific factors, the indicative starting imprisonment term for the s 354A charge should be pegged _below_ the five-year mark in Band 2. However, given the aggravating manner by which the Accused had conducted his defence, I decided to add an appropriate uplift to the sentence. I thus decided that the imprisonment term should be pegged at five years and no less.

135    I thus sentenced the Accused to **five years’ imprisonment** for the s 354 charge. I also imposed **six strokes of the cane**, in accordance with the framework in _BDA_.

136    I now move on to the appropriate sentence for the s 354 charge:

> (a)     As regards the offence-specific factors,

>> (i)       I did not agree with the Prosecution that this case fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework. Unlike in the case of the 354A charge, there was no skin-to-skin contact and no touching of the Complainant’s private parts for the s 354 charge. As explained above, I rejected the Prosecution’s submissions that deception and pre-meditation were aggravating factors in this case.

>> (ii)       Given the dearth of offence-specific aggravating factors, it was more appropriate to slot the s 354 charge into Band 1 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework (_ie_, less than five months’ imprisonment, as an indicative starting point).

>> (iii)       However, I was of the view that the s 354 charge lay at the _higher_ end of the Band 1 spectrum, given that there was an element of wrongful restraint. Specifically, the Accused had hugged the Complainant tightly while his erect penis jutted against her body. She tried to break free but was unsuccessful in doing so.

> (b)     As regards the offender-specific aggravating factors, I was of the view that the aggravating manner in which the Accused had conducted his defence (_ie_, making spurious accusations against so many innocent parties) similarly warranted an uplift to the sentence for the s 354 charge. An appropriate uplift would bring the sentence to the uppermost bounds of the Band 1 range.

> As such, I decided that the sentence for the s 354 charge should be fixed at **_five months_****.**

137    In imposing the above sentences, I placed little weight on the Accused’s plea in mitigation. As regards his contributions to the clan associations, the Accused had offered no link between those contributions and his capacity for reform: see _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span>.[^319] As regards the hardship that the Accused’s family would face as a result of his incarceration, this too was a factor which (short of exceptional circumstances) carried little currency in mitigating the sentence: _Lai Oei Mui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGHC 157</span>.

## Conclusion

138    Having found the Accused guilty after trial, I sentenced him as follows:

> (a)     Five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the s 354A charge; and

> (b)     Five months’ imprisonment for the s 354 charge.

Pursuant to the one transaction rule, I ordered the imprisonment terms for both charges to run concurrently.

139    The global sentence imposed was thus five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane
