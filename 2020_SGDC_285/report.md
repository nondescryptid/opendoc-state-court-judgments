Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Charge – Withdrawal – Discharge Not Amounting To An Acquittal

10 December 2020

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Gue Jeffery, a 54 year-old Singapore citizen was first charged in Court 26 on 11 October 2019 for two counts of aggravated cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) in **DAC-928704-2019** and **DAC-928705-2019**. He was alleged to have dishonestly induced one Hiroko Kobayashi to deliver the sums of $13,000 and $15,000 respectively for currencies exchange trading, a fact which he knew to be false. After several rounds of mentions and pre-trial conferences, his case was fixed for a three-day trial from 18 November 2020 to 20 November 2020.

2       Two days before the trial on 16 November 2020, in a letter that was copied to the Defence, the Prosecution informed the court that it would be applying for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the two charges as further evidence had surfaced in respect of the case and that time was required to verify the evidence.

## The Application

3       On 18 November 2020, the Prosecution applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal against the accused pursuant to s 232(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). It was submitted that the Public Prosecutor may decline to prosecute at any stage of the trial and that s 232(2) states that a discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless court so directs. In support of its application, the Prosecution had referred to the High Court decision in _PP v Ng Guan Hup_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 314</span> that had dealt with the application of the predecessor to this statutory provision namely, s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). It was further submitted based on this case, it is established law that the discretion on whether a discharge amounting to an acquittal or a discharge not amounting to an acquittal be ordered depends on balancing the public interest in ensuring criminal acts are punished as well as fairness to the accused.

4       The court was informed that the victim in the present case was contactable in this jurisdiction but certain information had come to light that would have an impact on the current charges. The police would need some time to look into this before the Prosecution could finalise its position. It was submitted that the balance favoured the granting of a discharge not amounting to an acquittal as the charges that accused has been charged with carries imprisonment of up to ten years. In addition, it was further submitted that this was not a case where the material witnesses have gone missing unlike that in _PP v Ng Guan Hup_.

5       In response to the application, the Defence had highlighted that the accused was first charged on 11 October 2019 and as of 18 November 2020, it had been one year one month and eight days. The parties had gone through multiple mentions as well as pre-trial conferences and criminal case disclosure conference directions had been given. The Defence had received the Case for the Prosecution, the Case for the Defence had been filed and they had received the Supplemental Bundle from the Prosecution. This matter has also gone through a Criminal Case Resolution conference and the matter was fixed for trial. Two days before the trial, the court received a letter in respect of the application. The reason for this application was that further evidence has surfaced in respect of the case and the Prosecution needed time to verify the same.

6       It was the Defence’s position that it was not asking for a discharge amounting to an acquittal unless the Prosecution was applying for the same. With reference to _PP v Ng Guan Hup_, it was submitted that the court has an unfettered discretion to grant a discharge amounting to an acquittal. The underlying theme in the exercise of that discretion was that it was a fine balance between the public interest in ensuring that the criminal acts were punished and fairness to the accused person.

7       As the Prosecution had indicated that further evidence had surfaced and as much work had been done, the Defence had applied for the matter to be transferred back to the pre-trial conference court instead. The pre-trial conference judge could give directions and time could be given to the Prosecution to ensure that criminal acts are punished. If there is evidence, then the criminal acts may be punished or shall be punished.

8       It was the Defence’s position that this was in fairness to the accused in not having the charges hanging over his head which is the effect of a discharge not amounting to acquittal. The Prosecution was at liberty to take the matter up at any time and the Defence would have to start all over again. It was suggested at the pre-trial conference, the Prosecution could decide if they want to further prosecute the charges. Time would be given for the Prosecution to verify the same and this would serve the balance between the public interest in ensuring criminal acts were punished and fairness to the accused. If the Prosecution decides to apply for discharge amounting to an acquittal, the application could be made to the court at the pre-trial conference stage.

9       In response this submissions, it was the Prosecution’s position that on a point of law, s 232(1) of the Criminal Procdure Code is clear that once the Public Prosecutor decides not to further prosecute on the charge, then the proceedings must be stayed and the accused is discharged on the same. As the provision is framed in mandatory terms, the decision for the court is for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal or a discharge amounting to an acquittal. It was not a question of whether or not the case was to be sent for a pre-trial conference. As for question of fairness, the Prosecution noted that as the matter had started in October 2019, the Court may direct a review in six months time so that it would give some certainty.

10     After having considered the address by both the Prosecution and the Defence, pursuant to s 232(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I ordered a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the two charges in DAC-928704-2019 and DAC-928705-2019. I further ordered that the matter is to be reviewed by the Prosecution within six months and the Prosecution is to provide the Defence with an update of the case by 8 May 2021.

11     On 27 November 2020, dissatisfied with my decision the accused filed a notice of appeal against my order. Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## The Court’s Decision

12     From the above, it would appear that the accused is dissatisfied with my decision to make the discharge order instead of remitting the matter back to the Pre-trial Conference Centre for further management of the matter. It was clear that the Defence’s position was that it was not asking for a discharge amounting to an acquittal unless the Prosecution was applying for the same.

13     The issue before me was whether s 232(1) of the Criminal Code was framed in mandatory terms such that once an application is made by the Public Prosecutor, the court before which the application is made must order that the proceedings be stayed and that the discretion of the court is only in respect of the nature of the discharge order or that the court had an unfettered discretion to make any type of appropriate order including remitting the matter back to the Pre-trial Conference Centre.

14     The relevant provision is set out below:

>      **Public Prosecutor may decline to further prosecute at any stage of trial**

> **232.**—(1)    At any stage of any proceedings in court —

>> (a)    before an accused is acquitted of any charge; or

>> (b)    where an accused has been convicted of any charge but before he is sentenced for that charge,

>     the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the accused upon the charge, and the proceedings on the charge against the accused must then be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same.

> (2)    Except in cases referred to in section 147, a discharge under subsection (1) shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court so directs.

15     In my view, it is clear from an ordinary reading of the above provision, that the court’s jurisdiction to grant a discharge under s 232 of the Criminal Procedure Code only arises when the Public Prosecutor informs the court that he would not further prosecute the accused upon the charge. I agreed with the Prosecution that once such an application is made, as the provision is framed in mandatory terms, the court must order that the proceedings be stayed and make the appropriate discharge order.

16     When the Prosecution invokes s 232(1), the court ought to be appraised of the relevant matters in support of the application for instance _eg_, the difficulty of tracing a material witness, the need for further investigations and its intention as to the likelihood of future prosecution of the accused on the charges. Only when such relevant facts are placed before the court, would the court be in a position to make the appropriate discharge order.

#### Principles underlying exercise of discretion

17     In my decision as to the appropriate discharge order to be made, I was guided by the principles enunciated by the High Court in _PP v Ng Guan Hup_ \[2009\] <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 314</span> at \[58\] to \[59\]:

>      **Principles underlying exercise of discretion.**

> 58    From the above authorities, it can be discerned that the underlying theme is that it is a fine balance between the public interest in ensuring that criminal acts are punished and fairness to the accused person. The public interest factor is given more weight where it pertains to a serious offence because the more serious the charge, the greater is the public interest in ensuring that an offender is punished for the offence. Conversely, where the offence involved is relatively minor, the accused should not be faced with a disproportionate delay.

> 59    On the other hand, fairness to the accused dictates that he be acquitted if the suspension in the prosecution is indefinite or likely to be long. The trial of any person accused of an offence should be conducted expeditiously so that he does not suffer the trauma of lengthy proceedings. If there is an adjournment, it should be as short as possible. However where there is a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, the accused person faces uncertainty as to whether the charge against him will resume. Where the delay is likely to be short, the court will naturally be slow to grant a discharge amounting to an acquittal. Where, as in _K Abdul Rasheed_ and _Goh Cheng Chuan_, the testimony of the witnesses cannot be procured in the foreseeable future and prosecution of the accused appears likely to be delayed for an indeterminate period, a discharge amounting to an acquittal will be granted. However, it does not necessarily follow that in all cases where an indefinite delay may occur, an accused will be granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal.

18     In my view on the facts before me, granting a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was an appropriate order. The Prosecution had informed the court that further evidence had surfaced in respect of the case and that time was required to verify the evidence. The victim, Miss Hiroko Kobayashi is contactable and there was no indication that any of the material witnesses were unavailable or not within the jurisdiction. It did not appear that the Prosecution had intended to leave matters suspended indefinitely. I was satisfied that the delay was likely to be short and that it was not an instance where prosecution of the accused appears likely to be delayed for an indeterminate period.

19     In any event, I had ordered that the matter was to be reviewed within six months from my order and that the Prosecution is to provide the Defence with an update of the matter by 8 May 2021. If the Prosecution was not forthcoming in providing an update within the prescribed timeline, the Defence was at liberty to inform the court and request that the matter be fixed for mention. All the trial preparation work that the Defence had done would not have gone to waste as the materials could still be used when the prosecution is ready to prosecute the accused in respect of the two charges.

20     In my view, it was clear that it would be prejudicial to public interest to allow the accused to be granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal, as public interest demanded that crimes be prosecuted and criminals brought to justice. This was more so if the charges were of a serious nature, as in the present case where there was a mandatory custodial sentence of up to ten years’ imprisonment and additionally the option of the imposition of a fine in respect of each charge.

21     In any event, a discharge amounting to an acquittal was not order that the Defence had sought but instead it had sought to have the matter remitted back to the Pre-trial Conference Centre for further management. I agreed with the Prosecution that remitting the case for a pre-trial conference was not an order the court could give. Instead the court must order that the proceedings be stayed and its discretion was only in respect of the appropriate discharge order to be made after a consideration of the relevant matters surrounding the application. Accordingly, in the exercise of my discretion, based on the facts before me I ordered a discharge not amounting to an aquittal.
