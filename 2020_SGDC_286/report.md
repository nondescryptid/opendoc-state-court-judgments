TORT – Defamation – Defamatory statements

15 December 2020

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendant for defamation relating to four statements made by the defendant in writing that were published during the period of 5 January 2019 to 22 May 2019. The statements are posted on Facebook and WhatsApp chat group.

2       According to the plaintiff, she is a well-known social media personality who creates content in the motorcycling and travel industry, and this is a source of her livelihood. She is also a verified public figure on Facebook and Instagram. As at 24 March 2020, she has over 50,000 followers. The defendant is a motorcycle enthusiast who works as the chief mechanic of Modern Vespa Singapore as well as the Operations Director of MarkMoto. The defamatory statements were made in relation to a dispute that the plaintiff had with a motorcycle workshop known as Revology Bikes Pte Ltd (“ Revology”) in which the plaintiff had received compensation from Revology for damage caused to her motorcycle, a Ducati 899 Panigale, when a camera was installed by Revology unto her motorcycle. The compensation was paid pursuant to a Small Claims Tribunal (“SCT”) ruling made in favour of the plaintiff in SCT/20691/2018.

3       After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I decide to grant an injunction ordering the defendant to remove the defamatory statements and for the defendant to be restrained from further publishing similar defamatory statements. As the statements referring to the plaintiff are indeed defamatory and have been published to a large number of users, I grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $40,000 for general damages and a sum of $20,000 for aggravated damages with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment for the said sums. I decline to award special damages resulting from the termination of the plaintiff’s collaboration with Samsung as the plaintiff has not proven on a balance of probabilities that Samsung has terminated their contract due to the defendant’s defamatory statements. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Facts

### The parties

4       I will first provide a general sequence of events which facilitates better understanding of the issues that are before this Court for determination. In October 2018, Revology offered the plaintiff a camera to be installed without payment unto her motorcycle in return for the plaintiff reviewing the camera. After the plaintiff accepted the offer, she brought her motorcycle to Revology’s workshop for the installation on 18 October 2018. On 25 October 2018, the plaintiff put up a promotional post for Revology in her Instagram, but the post has since been removed.

5       On 19 November 2018, the plaintiff serviced her motorcycle at Bikeworkz Pte Ltd (“Bikeworkz”) which indicated that no damage was caused to the plaintiff’ motorcycle due the installation. Subsequently, as the plaintiff encountered several issues with the camera, Mr Darren Sim Hon Kiat, a director of Revology informed the plaintiff to return the camera and replace it with a new one.

6       On the 4 December 2018, the plaintiff visited Revology premises to effect the replacement. In the process of removing and reinstalling the camera, the plaintiff claimed that her motorcycle was damaged in that the process resulted in a sizeable gap between the body of the motorcycle and the fairings. On 5 December 2018, she informed Mr Sim of this issue. On 6 December 2018, she published a blog post of her disappointing experience. On 7 December 2018, she brought her motorcycle to Bikeworkz for inspection and the mechanic found the left and right front catch of the fairings were broken. She then took pictures and sent them to Mr Sim. On the same day, Mr Jerome Lee Jian Rong, another director of Revology contacted the plaintiff and admitted that the issue was caused by his staff’s negligence. On 8 December 2018, Mr Lee offered compensation to the plaintiff provided she removed her media posts and would state that the incident was due to a misunderstanding. The plaintiff rejected the offer.

7       The plaintiff issued a letter of demand to Revology on 12 December 2018. This was followed by a SCT claim filed on 21 December 2018. On 30 December 2018, the plaintiff published a Facebook post with a link documenting the incident with Revology.

8       On 5 January 2019, the defendant posted the first defamatory statement in the comments section of the plaintiff’s Facebook post of 30 December 2018. In the post, the defendant called the plaintiff “cheapskate”, “freeloader” and a “poser”. He also accused her of cyber bullying. On 27 February 2019, he published the second defamatory statement in his Facebook page. In essence, he questioned the plaintiff’s integrity and whether a gap in the fairings caused during a visit to the bike shop was a lie. He also stated that “karma is also real”. He also tagged the plaintiff’s past, present and potential sponsors, business partners and other motorcycle workshops. In or around March 2019, the defendant published the third defamatory statement in a WhatsApp group chat which the plaintiff claimed has at least 40 members. There is also a link to the defendant’s second defamatory statement in his Facebook post. In this chat, the defendant stated “Vauhne Phan cheating ah? (laughing face emoji) Karma coming soon”.

9       The Small Claims Tribunal decided in the plaintiff’s favour and ordered Revology to pay $4,630 for the replacement of the fairings and repair of the motorcycle. On 5 April 2019, Revology paid the damages as ordered.

10     On or around April 2019, the plaintiff contracted with Cohn & Wolfe XPR Pte Ltd (“C&W”) to appear in an advertisement to promote a new Samsung mobile phone. This advertisement was then posted on Samsung’s Facebook page.

11     A letter of demand was sent by the plaintiff’s former lawyers to the defendant to remove the first and second defamatory statements. On 22 May 2019, the defendant using a Facebook account under the name of “Singapore Team Tmax” posted the fourth defamatory statement as a comment on Samsung’s Facebook post. In this comment addressed to Samsung, the defendant stated that Samsung should do homework and fact finding before hiring an influencer and there are plenty of capable young men/women who can show Samsung what dirt biking means. On 24 May 2019, C&W informed the plaintiff of the defendant’s fourth defamatory post and removed the advertisement featuring the plaintiff from Samsung’s Facebook page. C&W terminated the contract with the plaintiff.

12     A total of five witnesses gave evidence in court. Other than the plaintiff, the four defendant’s witnesses were Muhammad Hidayat bin Ahmad Harini (“Hidayat” who is a trader in motorcycle parts as owner of Yatz Industries), Tony Alfred Desire Devaux (“Devaux” who works for Ducati), Darren Sim (a director of Revology) and the defendant.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

13     The plaintiff takes the position that all four statements are defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning. Alternatively, for the third and fourth statements, these were defamatory by way of innuendo. These statements have adversely affected the plaintiff’s reputation. Although the defendant had pleaded the defence of justification, this defence directly goes against the ruling of the SCT which found Revology liable to pay compensation to the plaintiff for damage caused to her motorcycle. The District Court is in no position to review the decision of the SCT. The defamatory statements have not only caused the plaintiff distress as the defendant acted maliciously against her, the statements have also caused her direct monetary loss. Hence, the plaintiff should be compensated with general and aggravated damages as well as special damages. Other than removal of the first and second defamatory statements, an injunction should also be issued against the defendant for posting further similar defamatory statements about the plaintiff.

### The defendant’s version

14     The defendant’s position is that the statements are not defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning[^1]. The defendant also alleges that the plaintiff’s popularity has already been waning. Even if the statements are defamatory, the defence of justification applies[^2]. For the first defamatory post, the plaintiff had accepted Revology’s camera for free and his word” cheapskate” refers to her accepting this free gift and service from Revology. According to the defendant, the plaintiff used her position as a social media personality to make negative comments on Revology without first reaching out to Revology for a resolution makes for a case of cyber bullying. Her popularity has also been declining among motorcycle workshops. As for the second defamatory statement, his position is that the gap between the body of the motorcycle and the fairings were not caused by Revology, but these were pre-existing gaps. This is because the plaintiff had replaced the motorcycle’s original fairings with replica fairings which are less durable. As for the third defamatory statement, the defendant contends that he had intended to downplay the seriousness of the plaintiff’s actions with a laughing emoji. As for the fourth defamatory statement, his explanation is that it was a comment for Samsung to feature a more experienced dirt biker in order to improve their outreach.

## Issues to be determined

15     The issues before the Court are as follows:

> a.     Are the four statements made by the defendant defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning?

> b.     If the four statements are defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning, has the defendant established a defence that the defamatory statements do not lower the plaintiff’s reputation, and has he made out a defence of justification?

> c.     If the defendant is liable, what are the reliefs to be granted by the Court?

## Issue 1: Are the four statements made by the defendant defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning?

16     The law on defamation is trite. As enunciated by the High Court in _Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 751</span>, the plaintiff in his/her claim for defamation, has to prove that a statement was made with defamatory meaning, there was publication to a third party and reference was made to the plaintiff. [^3] A statement has a defamatory meaning if it has any of the following effects[^4]:

> a.     lowers the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society;

> b.     causes the plaintiff to be shunned;

> c.     exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

17     As for the test in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of, the Court of Appeal[^5] has consistently decided that the test is what meaning the words would convey to an ordinary reasonable person using their general knowledge and common sense. It is irrelevant what the maker of the statement had intended to mean by them. The meaning must be gathered from the words themselves and in the context of the entire speech.

18     I find that the four statements are defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning. It is undisputed that there has been publication to third party as the statements were published in Facebook and WhatsApp assessible by a large number of users and the words have been understood by the users as referring to the plaintiff. The main contention between the parties is whether the statements are defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning. I shall now elaborate.

### First defamatory statement

19     In the first defamatory statement made during the period 5 January 2019 to 9 January 2019 which were published as a series of comments on the plaintiff’s Facebook post-dated 30 December 2018, the defendant used the words “cheapskate”, “freeloader”, “poser” and accused the plaintiff of “cyberbullying”. In addition, the defendant also commented that she has a black heart. He also mentioned that he was looking forward to seeing her at “Wicked Wallop”. The defendant’s explanation was that the words “cheapskate” and “freeloader” were used in colloquial sense.[^6] I agree with the plaintiff that these words when read by an ordinary reasonable person would understand them to mean in a negative fashion to a person who does not want to spend unnecessarily and would try to obtain as many things as possible without paying for them. Even if I were to take the defendant’s case at its highest, reading these words in the context of the rest of the messages, these are words used with a negative connotation.

20     The defendant called the plaintiff a poser which is “always dying for attention and leverage.” During cross-examination, the defendant testified that he used the word “poser” to refer to the plaintiff pretending to be someone who she is not, and she is pretending to be righteous when she had lied in the SCT proceedings. This is defamatory as this is referring to the plaintiff as a person who is desperate for attention and will portray a false image of herself as a highly experienced or reputed motorcyclist to obtain attention.

21     The defendant also accused the plaintiff of “cyberbullying” and has a “black heart” as she had falsely accused Revology of causing the gaps in her motorcycle due to installation of the camera. A reasonable person reading this would interpret this to mean a person who exerts undue pressure on others to achieve what he wants. Describing a person as having a black heart is defamatory as it means that the person is evil with ill intentions. Hence, this statement would be defamatory. As for the reference to “Wicked Wallop”, I accept that this refers to a motorcycling event and does not refer to the plaintiff being a wicked person. However, when read as a whole, the first statement is indeed defamatory in its ordinary and natural meaning when read by an ordinary and reasonable person.

### Second defamatory statement

22     On 27 February 2019, the second defamatory statement was made by way of the defendant’s post on his Facebook page. This is a public post. It refers to the gap in the fairings and according to the defendant, the gaps were there almost 6 months before installation of the camera. So he posted that “Facts are facts and lies will be lies. Karma is also real.” In addition, he also posted that “So, do we still need answers now? Who is telling the truth and who is lying?”

23     It is largely undisputed that the defendant had implied in his Facebook statement that he is questioning the integrity of the plaintiff and that she lied in her blogpost and SCT proceedings about the gaps in the fairings. It is defamatory in its ordinary and natural meaning as the defendant is calling the plaintiff a liar.

### Third defamatory statement

24     In March 2019, the defendant published a message to a WhatsApp group that “Vauhne Phan cheating ah? (laughing face emoji) Karma coming soon \[hyperlink to Statement 2\]”. This is clearly defamatory as he accuses her of being a cheat and that she will be punished for it.

### Fourth defamatory statement

25     On 22 May 2019, the defendant posted through Facebook group “Singapore Team Tmax” by way of a comment in a public post by Samsung in the advertisement featuring the plaintiff that Samsung should “take this more seriously and do some homework and fact finding before hiring an influencer. The biking community is very small in SG.”

26     This is also defamatory in its ordinary and natural meaning as an ordinary and reasonable man reading this would understand the defendant’s words to mean that the plaintiff is not worthy of being featured in the Samsung advertisement.

27     As I find that the third and fourth statements are defamatory in ordinary and natural meaning, there is no necessity for me to find that these are defamatory by way of innuendo.

## Issue 2: If the four statements are defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning, has the defendant established a defence that the defamatory statements do not lower the plaintiff’s reputation, and has he made out a defence of justification?

28     I find that the both defences have not been made out. I shall now outline my reasons.

### Defence that plaintiff’s reputation has not been lowered

29     According to the defendant, the plaintiff’s popularity was already waning prior to the defendant’s statements. The last news coverage was in 2017 in the Chinese press[^7]. The defendant’s position is that the plaintiff has also been receiving negative comments in Facebook advertisements for DirectAsia Insurance, Uniqlo and Samsung.[^8]

30     I find that the plaintiff’s reputation has been lowered as a result of the defendant’s defamatory statements. The increase in the statistics on the number of followers of the plaintiff’s social media shows that she has an extensive online social media presence and publication of defamatory statements would indeed lower her reputation. The number of followers increased from around 40,000 followers in April 2018 to 54,735 followers as at March 2020.[^9] The number of “likes” also increased in the same period from 40,000 in April 2018 to 51,678 in March 2020.[^10]

### Defence of justification

31     The defendant quoted two decisions. In support of his position that to successfully plead the defence of justification, only the substance of gist of the defamatory material has to be justified. One is the Court of Appeal decision in _Aaron Anne Joseph and others v Cheong Yip Seng and others_ \[1996\] 1 SLR (R) 258. In the High Court decision of _ANB v ANF_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 329</span>, where several defamatory statements contain a common sting, the defendant can seek to justify the common sting.

32     For the first three statements[^11], the gist which the defendant seeks to justify is that the plaintiff obtained the camera and the installation service free of charge from Revology, the gaps in the plaintiff’s motorcycle existed even before she first attended at Revology and the plaintiff has a “black heart” as she accused Revology of damaging her motorcycle and wrote negative things about Revology in her blog although the latter had acceded to her many requests out of goodwill; for example, the plaintiff’s last minute appointment changes. For the fourth statement[^12], the defendant claims that he only needs to justify that Samsung could have featured a more experienced dirt biker in its advertisement.

33     For the first three statements, the defendant claims that the defamatory words such as “cheapskate”, “freeloader” and “poser” were justified as other internet users also used similar words to describe the plaintiff.[^13] The defendant goes on to further justify that the plaintiff had used after-market China fairings bought from Yatz Industries for $200 but claims $480 from Revology and that she even attempted to obtain them for free in exchange for promoting it online[^14]. Despite her unhappiness with the camera, she did not return the camera[^15]. He also asserts that the plaintiff was untruthful about the pre-existing gaps in the plaintiff’s motorcycle caused by the after-market fairings.[^16] As she had falsely accused Revology, she has a “black heart” and by his own definition, “black heart” means “evil”.

34     As for the fourth statement, the defendant asserts that he was justified in making that statement as the plaintiff had a stunt double and failed to produce evidence of the awards that she had won for riding motorcycles. According to the defendant, the plaintiff conceded that there are more experienced dirt bikers than her.[^17]

35     The defendant’s position is that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to the SCT proceedings and does not preclude the defendant from proving that the plaintiff lied during the SCT proceedings[^18]. With due respect, I am of the view this is a misconceived argument. The defendant has acknowledged he was not a party to the SCT proceedings. Therefore, he is clearly not in the position to challenge the findings and submissions made by the parties in the SCT proceedings. This would continue to apply to the current suit. Taking the defendant’s argument to its extreme, assuming this Court finds that the plaintiff had lied in the SCT proceedings or the evidence presented in the SCT proceedings was not properly evaluated by the Tribunal, it is tantamount to this Court finding that the SCT decision was unsound. My view is that it is not open to this Court to examine the SCT decision and findings of fact. SCT is clearly a court of competent jurisdiction.

36     In this regard, I agree with the plaintiff that the extended doctrine of res judicata as enunciated by the High Court in _Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 229</span> at \[58\] applies. A party should not be vexed twice in the same matter as there should be finality in litigation. As such, the extended doctrine of res judicata applies to prevent such abuse of process. I agree with the plaintiff that there is no fresh evidence or special circumstances that warrant re-litigation[^19].

37     In the first defamatory post of 5 January 2019, the defendant called the plaintiff a “cheapskate” and “freeloader”. I agree with the plaintiff that although some internet users have also used the words “cheapskate” and “freeloader” to refer to the plaintiff, this does not absolve the defendant from liability[^20]. According to him, the plaintiff is a “cheapskate” because she sued Revology at SCT, removed her review posting and left Revology with nothing. In his mind, she is a “freeloader” because she lied at SCT to obtain a ruling in her favour and she inflated her claims.

38     I find for the plaintiff in that she is not a “cheapskate” nor a “freeloader”. During cross-examination, Mr Sim testified that the camera was a gift and in return he had hoped that the plaintiff would publicise it. Mr Jerome Lee, another director of Revology had stated that the purpose was to gain “better traction for the product”. The camera was not sponsorship as it was up to the plaintiff whether she wrote a good review. In the circumstances, Mr Sim agreed that he would not call her a “cheapskate” and he also agreed that she is not a “freeloader”. In short, this means that this is a form of “barter trade” in which the plaintiff received a camera without charge and in return, she was expected to post a review about the camera which she did.

39     The defendant also called her a “poser” and alleged that she engaged in “cyberbullying”. According to the defendant, the plaintiff is a “poser” as she was pretending to be righteous as the faulty camera was still on her motorcycle and despite receiving compensation from Revology pursuant to the SCT ruling, she had yet to repair her motorcycle. He also stated that the plaintiff’s behaviour caused loss to Revology’s business and was therefore “cyberbullying”. I do not see how the defendant is justified in commenting that the plaintiff has a “black heart” as the plaintiff was describing her experience with Revology in her blogpost.[^21]

40     I find for the plaintiff that there is no justification on the defendant’s part in calling the plaintiff a “poser” and that she did not engage in cyberbullying. It is up to the plaintiff when she has her motorcycle repaired after receiving compensation. As the SCT ruling stands and Revology has paid compensation to the plaintiff pursuant to such ruling, I disagree how such facts when made public can constitute cyberbullying.

41     As for the second defamatory statement made on 27 February 2019, the defendant questioned the integrity of the plaintiff regarding the gap in the fairings of the plaintiff’s motorcycle. He also tagged the plaintiff’s past, present and potential sponsors, business partners and other motorcycle workshops. The defendant’s explanation is that he took it upon himself to act as a “vigilante” because he claimed that he felt a responsibility, as a person in motorcycle trade, to let people know the truth.[^22]

42     The evidence given by Hidayat and Devaux are of limited weightage. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff[^23], Hidayat was in court to testify that he had bought fairings from China which he had supplied to be fixed on the plaintiff’s motorcycle and he was not the one who installed the fairings. More importantly, Hidayat did not examine the plaintiff’s motorcycle on 5 December 2018 when Revology’s mechanic worked on the plaintiff’s motorcycle. Therefore, he is not in the position to comment on the gap. As for Devaux, he was called as a witness of fact and his AEIC is not in compliance with the prescribed format in Order 40A rule 3(e) for expert AEICs. Similarly, for Devaux, he had not examined the plaintiff’s motorcycle before and after Revology’s staff had installed the camera nor has he read the parties’ pleadings or the plaintiff’s AEIC prior to the provision of his opinion.[^24]

43     I find for the plaintiff as the SCT ruling stands. Mr Jerome Lee, a director of Revology had apologised[^25] for negligence of the Revology’s staff in Mr Lee’s message sent on 7 December 2018. In addition, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated damages as the defendant had acted out of malice by tagging the plaintiff’s past, present and potential sponsors, business partners and other motorcycle workshops. By his own evidence in court, he intended for these people to know what the plaintiff was like.

## Issue 3: If the defendant is liable, what are the reliefs to be granted by the Court?

44     Having found the defendant liable for the four defamatory statements, I grant the reliefs as outlined below.

### Injunctions

45     A final mandatory injunction is granted against the defendant to remove the defamatory statements that he has made against the plaintiff. In addition, a final injunction is also granted against the defendant making further publication of similar defamatory remarks or comments against the plaintiff.

## General damages

46     The plaintiff has submitted the sum of $60,000 for general damages with statutory interest thereon from date of writ to judgment[^26]. As for the circumstances to consider when quantifying general damages to be awarded, these have been outlined in the Court of Appeal decision in _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and anor and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGCA 26</span>:

> a.     the nature and gravity of the defamation;

> b.     the conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the defendant;

> c.     the mode and extent of publication;

> d.     the natural indignation of the court at the injury caused to the plaintiff;

> e.     the conduct of the defendant from the time the defamatory statement is published to the very moment of the verdict;

> f.     the failure to apologise and retract the defamatory statement;

> g.     the presence of malice.

47     In comparison, the defendant has submitted $1,500 as general damages if this Court finds the defendant liable for defamation [^27]. My view is that the plaintiff would not be at the top of the scale in terms of awards as her reputation is confined mainly to those in the motorcycle industry as opposed to a politician, whose reputation is of significance to the country as well as external foreign individuals and entities and states that deal with the country and/or the politician concerned. The defendant has thus far declined to apologise for the defamatory statements nor retract the same and has gone on to make more posts after the present suit was filed[^28]. Given that the plaintiff is a professional social media personality with extensive number of followers, I hereby award the general damages in the sum of $40,000 with statutory interest thereon from date of writ to judgment. This is similar to the sum awarded in _Tan Tor Teng Jerome v Koh Nai Hock_ (unreported decision) in DC 1184/2012.[^29]

## Aggravated damages

48     The plaintiff has submitted the sum of $60,000 for aggravated damages with statutory interest thereon from date of writ to judgment[^30]. The defendant has submitted that no sum be awarded.[^31] As for aggravated damages, the High Court in _Lee Hsien Loong v Ngerng Yi Ling Roy_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 320</span> provided the following instructive guidance on the factors to consider:

> a.     failure to make any or any sufficient apology or withdrawal;

> b    a repetition of libel;

> c.     conduct calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding;

> d.     persistence by way of a prolonged or hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff;

> e.     a plea of justification which is bound to fail;

> f.     general conduct either of the preliminaries or the trial itself calculated to attract a wide publicity;

> g.     persecution of the plaintiff by other means.

49     I find that the plaintiff is entitled to aggravated damages as the defendant has not made any apology to the plaintiff to-date. He made four defamatory statements which are the subject matter of the present suit and continued to make more posts even when the trial has commenced. These newer posts have been attached to the plaintiff’s closing submissions dated 11 November 2020. References were made in the defendant’s Facebook posts to “dishonesty” of the plaintiff and “rubbish content” that the plaintiff is creating. This conduct of the defendant is malicious in that he repeatedly persists in making negative comments about the plaintiff. As highlighted earlier, the defendant had acted out of malice by tagging the plaintiff’s sponsors, business partners and other motorcycle workshops in his second defamatory statement. In the circumstances, I hereby award the sum of $ 20,000 as aggravated damages to the plaintiff with the usual statutory interest thereon. This is similar to the sum awarded in _Liow Wang Wu v Pang Ah San_ (unreported decision) in DC 2058/2014. [^32]

## Special damages

50     The plaintiff has claimed for special damages arising from the termination of her contract with Samsung for the sum of $6,404[^33]. Samsung was to pay her $11,400 for the commercial of which $4,996 was received by the plaintiff. The defendant has submitted that no sum be awarded[^34]. However, I find that she has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the termination is due to the defendant’s defamatory statements. There are other factors which had led to the termination of the contract.

51     It is provided in the plaintiff’s contract with C&W for the Samsung commercial that C&W may terminate the contract under the following conditions:

> a.     Does not fulfil any of their obligations under the agreement.

> b.     Is subjected or involved in cases of alleged unlawful actions or any form of offense against public sensitivity, that C&W deems harmful to its name and image, or the Engagement or Engagement organiser’s name and image.

> c.     Omits to advise the company of any fact or situation that C&W should be aware of, as a counterparty of this contract.

52     By the plaintiff’s own admission[^35], she should have declared her dispute with Revology to C&W and C&W informed her that termination was due to her being involved in something negative[^36]. She also conceded that Samsung terminated the contract due to this breach of contract.

## Conclusion

53     For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff has proven her claim on a balance of probabilities and therefore grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff as outlined above. I will now hear parties on costs.
