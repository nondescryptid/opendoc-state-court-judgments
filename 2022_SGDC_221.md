### District Judge Paul Chan:

1       The accused, Mr Ng Wee Soon, is a Singapore citizen, aged 44. At all material times, he was the sole proprietor of Universe Motoring. In 2019, two individuals agreed to purchase cars from Universe Motoring and, to that end, entrusted the accused with substantial sums of money. However, the accused dishonestly misappropriated the money by using the money to settle the debts of Universe Motoring. Arising from these and another similar incident, the accused faced three charges of criminal breach of trust under section 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). He pleaded guilty to two of these charges and consented to have the last charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. After hearing submissions from parties, I sentenced the accused to an aggregate imprisonment term of nine months. The accused has lodged an appeal against sentence.

## The charges

2       The charges to which the accused pleaded guilty are as follows.

> DAC-912248-2021 (“**2nd charge**”)

> You… are charged that you, sometime around September 2019, in Singapore, having been entrusted with property, _to wit_, SGD$69,900.00, did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-912249-2021 (“**3rd charge**”)

> You… are charged that you, sometime around September 2019, in Singapore, having been entrusted with property, _to wit_, SGD$12,619.25, did commit criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       The accused admitted to another charge of criminal breach of trust and consented to have it taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

## Facts

4       The facts in support of the charges were set out in the Statement of Facts, and were admitted without qualification by the accused. The Statement of Facts stated as follows.

> 2.    At the material time, the accused was the sole proprietor of Universe Motoring.

> 3.    The bank account of Universe Motoring is an OCBC account bearing account number \[xxx\] (“**Universe Motoring’s bank account**”). The accused had access to Universe Motoring’s bank account and he was the authorised signatory.

> **_First Information Reports for the 2nd and 3rd Charges (DAC-912248-2021 and DAC-912249-2021)_**

> 4.    On 17 September 2019, at about 6.37pm, Su Tow Keong lodged a police report stating that, after making full payment for a car, the ownership of the car was not transferred to him.

> 5.    On 17 September 2019, at about 12.07pm, Thandar Win lodged a police report stating that, after making full payment for a car, the car had been repossessed.

> **_Facts pertaining to the 2nd and 3rd Charges (DAC-912248-2021 and DAC-912249-2021)_**

> 6.    On 7 September 2019, one Su Tow Keong agreed to buy a motor vehicle bearing registration number SLK3891A (“**the SLK Car**”) from Universe Motoring for SGD$69,500.00.

> 7.    Between 7 September 2019 to 9 September 2019, Su Tow Keong paid the accused the total sum of SGD$69,900.00, which was paid into Universe Motoring’s bank account for the purchase of the SLK Car and for administrative fees. Su Tow Keong thereby entrusted the accused with SGD$69,900.00.

> 8.    On 15 September 2019, Thandar Win agreed to buy a motor vehicle bearing registration number SMN580P (“**the SMN Car**”) from Universe Motoring for SGD$12,619.25. Around 15 September 2019, Thandar Win paid the accused the total sum of SGD$12,619.25, which was paid into Universe Motoring’s bank account for the purchase of the SMN Car. Thandar Win thereby entrusted the accused with SGD$12,619.25.

> 9.    Sometime around September 2019, the accused dishonestly misappropriated the money which he was entrusted with (as set out in \[7\] and \[8\]) by using the money to settle the debts of Universe Motoring. As a result, the ownership of the SLK Car was not transferred to Su Tow Keong and the ownership of the SMN Car was not transferred to Thandar Win.

> 10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed two counts of criminal breach of trust, punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 11.    The SLK Car and the SMN Car were subsequently repossessed by Tokyo Century Leasing Pte Ltd due to the debts owed by Universe Motoring.

5       In August 2022, prior to being sentenced, the accused made full restitution of the amounts misappropriated to the victims.

## Prescribed Penalty

6       Under section 406 of the Penal Code, whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.

## Antecedents

7       The accused had an unrelated traffic antecedent for which he was fined in 2004 and disqualified from driving for a period.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that that accused should be sentenced to ten to 13 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd charge and 13 weeks’ imprisonment for the 3rd charge. The two sentences should run concurrently, resulting in an aggregate sentence of ten to 13 months’ imprisonment. In making this submission, the Prosecution took into account the restitution made by the accused.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

9       The Defence highlighted that the accused pleaded guilty, he has made full restitution and that he should be considered a first offender. The Defence further submitted that the accused was genuinely remorseful and that the present case did not present significant aggravating factors. Having regard to these considerations, the Defence submitted that the accused should be sentenced to six and two months’ imprisonment for the 2nd and 3rd charges, respectively. As with the Prosecution, the Defence took the position that the sentences should run concurrently, thereby yielding an aggregate imprisonment term of 6 months.

## Judgment of the Court

10     Where offences for criminal breach of trust are concerned, the key sentencing considerations are general and specific deterrence: see _Tan Kim Hock Anthony v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 795</span> (at \[43\]). Hence, any sentence to be imposed on the accused must be guided by these considerations.

11     The harm caused by criminal breach of trust offences manifests itself on at least two levels. First, the offence caused to society. Second, the economic harm suffered by the victims. In this regard, it has been held that “\[i\]n an offence like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court”: _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span> (“**_Philip Wong_**”) (at \[18\]). In the present case, the two proceeded charges involved a total amount of $82,519.25. The restitution made by the accused has reduced the economic harm suffered by the victims but has not eliminated it altogether. Given that the restitution was made only almost three years after the monies were misappropriated, the victims had been put out of pocket for a significant period.

12     I accepted that the accused was remorseful to a degree as evidenced by his plea of guilt and his willingness to make voluntary restitution. I was mindful that the restitution was made at a very late stage of the judicial proceedings but I did not discount it altogether. I was also mindful that the accused had no other relevant antecedents, suggesting that the offences, which were all committed around the same time, may be an aberration. I accorded mitigatory weight to these factors.

13     The parties referred me to several sentencing precedents, as follows:

> (a)     In _Public Prosecutor v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span> (“**_Osi Maria_**”), the High Court considered a case where the offender was charged with committing criminal breach of trust in the amount of $14,089.95. Another similar charge in respect of $12,534.30 was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The offender was untraced and made full restitution. The High Court overturned a fine which was imposed in the first instance and imposed an imprisonment term of 15 weeks.

> (b)     The offender in _Raj Kumar s/o Brisa Besnath v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 57</span> (“**_Raj Kumar_**”) claimed trial to a charge of misappropriating $81,000. No restitution was made. He was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)     The offender in _Public Prosecutor v M Akbar Bin Mohamed Ibrahim_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 61</span> claimed trial to seven charges of committing criminal breach of trust, amounting to a total of $15,600. He had no antecedents and did not appear to have made any restitution. He was sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 34 weeks and ordered to make compensation in the sum of $47,600.

> (d)     The case of _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nur Sheqal Bin Azis_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 190</span> involved a single criminal breach of trust charge. 106 items with a total value of at least $34,035.08 were misappropriated. The offender committed his offences over five to six months. The Court found it aggravating that the offender’s conduct was vindictive. No restitution was made but the 106 items were fully recovered. The offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

14     The Defence also used the case of _Philip Wong_ as a sentencing precedent but I did not find that case to be of great utility given that _Philip Wong_ involved the misappropriation of a total of $1,841,232.20. The scale of offending in _Philip Wong_ was so different from the present case that, in my view, no useful comparison may be had.

15     Having regard to the above cases, I sentenced the accused to nine months’ imprisonment and ten weeks’ imprisonment for the 2nd and 3rd charges, respectively. I considered the Defence’s submission of six and two months’ imprisonment for the two charges, respectively, to be out of line with the sentence imposed in _Osi Maria_. I found the case of _Raj Kumar_ to be a useful reference point, especially in relation to the 2nd charge. However, the offender in _Raj Kumar_ claimed trial and did not make any restitution whatsoever. I therefore made appropriate calibrations to account for the fact that the accused in the present case pleaded guilty and made full restitution. I also had regard to the amounts involved in 2nd and 3rd charges.

## Conclusion

16     Both parties in the present case considered that the two sentences should run concurrently. Having regard to the totality principle, I agreed with this position and so ordered. This resulted in an aggregate sentence of nine months’ imprisonment. The accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
