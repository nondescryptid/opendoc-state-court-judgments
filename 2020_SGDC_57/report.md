2       At the conclusion of the trial, the Accused was found guilty and convicted on the said charge. He was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 4 years 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane.

3       The Accused is appealing against his sentence.

## Summary of Facts

4       The victim was about 12 years old at the time of the offence. She was the stepdaughter of the Accused. DW2 was her stepbrother. The Accused was at the material time the boyfriend of her mother and father of DW2.

5       On 28 August 2019, the victim was sleeping in her room. Her stepbrother was sleeping beside her. The victim was not aware of the presence of her mother. In her mind, she thought her mother had gone to the hospital to seek treatment for her jaw. The Accused had earlier punched her jaw.

6       At around 3am on 28 August 2019, the victim felt someone touching her left side breast. It was the Accused, who was using his hand to touch her left breast under her bra. The Accused made skin-to-skin contact on her left breast for about one minute by moving his hand around her breast. The victim was shocked and scared by the Accused’s actions. The Accused pulled the victim’s hair towards his penis. She resisted but in vain as the Accused was too strong. In the process, the Accused slapped the victim twice. She was also afraid to leave the room, as she knew the Accused could be violent. She was aware of the past violent conduct of the Accused towards her mother. She resorted to go back to bed by covering herself with her stepbrother’s jacket and took his bolster.

7       At about 5am, the alarm rang and her mother came in. The victim then went to school.

8       In school, the victim was observed to be “very down, teary, and not her usual self”. Eventually she reluctantly confided to her school counsellor Sivasubramaniam Shakini (PW5) what had happened. PW5 noted that the victim cried and was traumatised over the incident. PW5 asked the victim to pen down what had happened which she did so. It was to facilitate the reporting of the incident to the Police. The Police seized the note written by the victim. See exhibit P10. PW5 confirmed that she did not teach the victim how to write P10 other than to ask her to strike out the repeated words “when (sic) to my brother (sic) bed” and to insert the word “tie” before the word “my hair”.

9       PW5 then accompanied the victim to the police station where they met Joanne Hee Jie Yih (PW6), a social worker from the Child Protection Specialist Centre. PW6’s role was to ensure the safety of children at home. The victim was a client of PW6. PW6 had been working with the victim’s family since 2018. She also helped to place the victim with a foster family.

10     PW6 testified that the incident has caused the victim to be fearful of the Accused and other males.

## Guilty and Convicted

11     I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused did cause hurt to the victim in order to facilitate the commission of the offence against the victim. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge

## Antecedents

12     The Accused had antecedents relating to illegal money lending, consumption of drug and offences against person. I will only highlight the relevant criminal records.

13     On 26 August 2016, the Accused was convicted and sentenced to 1 week’s imprisonment for one count of s 323 Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt to the victim’s mother (PW7) who was his live-in girlfriend. The Accused reoffended again on13 November 2019. He was convicted and sentenced to a global term of 8 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 Penal Code and committing criminal intimidation under s 506 (1st limb) Penal Code against PW7. One charge of voluntarily causing hurt against the victim under s 323 Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Submission on Sentence

14     The Prosecution tendered a written submission on sentence. Relying on the sentencing framework in _PP v BDA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 72</span> (“BDA”) ( which adopted the framework the laid down in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[73\]) for the offence of outrage of modesty cases under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution submitted the appropriate sentence for the present case would be at least 5 years’ imprisonment and at least 6 strokes of the cane for the charge under s 354A(2)(b) of the Penal Code.

## Mitigation

15     The Accused did not submit on any relevant mitigation.

## Sentence

16     Clearly, in this case the main sentencing consideration must be one of deterrence. I also noted that the punishment prescribed for the offence committed by the Accused was a mandatory imprisonment term of not less than 3 years and not more than 10 years and with caning.

17     In determining the appropriate sentence, I applied the “two-step sentencing bands” approach applied in _BDA_. I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case fell within Band 2. See Prosecution’s submission at \[6\] and _BDA_ at \[77\].

18     First, I determined the relevant offence-specific factors. I was of the view that there was a high degree of sexual exploitation. The intrusions involved skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s left breast persistently for a about a minute and the Accused forcefully pulled the victim’s head towards his penis 3 to 4 times. I noted that there was no clear evidence that the penis was exposed.

19     There was abuse of position of trust and authority as the victim looked upon the Accused as a father figure. The acts of abuse were committed in the family home.

20     I also took into account the psychological harm caused to the victim. The incident caused her to be fearful of the Accused and males generally.

21     With respect, I did not give much weight to the age of the victim in this case, as she was not materially younger than the stipulated age ceiling stated in s 354A(2)(b) Penal Code. At the time of the offence, the victim was about 12 years old. Further, there was no evidence of any mental or infirmities that rendered the victim to be particularly vulnerable. _See GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> _at_ \[29\](f)_._

22     Based on the above, I placed the Accused within Band 2 of the sentencing bands, which carried a sentence of four to seven years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

23     Next, I took into account the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors to calibrate the appropriate sentence. There was no mitigating factor in this case.

24     On the other hand, I found there was the sheer lack of remorse on the part of the Accused. I agreed with the Prosecution that the fact that the Accused was traced for violence-related offences against his own family was an aggravating factor because it signalled a greater need for specific deterrence against the accused (see _Tan Kay Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[14\]). I also noted that the Accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence.

## Conclusion

25     In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 4 years 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane. At the time of sentencing, the Accused was serving his sentence for an unrelated offence. I ordered the current sentence to commence upon the expiry of his term of imprisonment.

26     In my view, the sentence was appropriate to reflect the culpability of the Accused and the harm caused to the victim.
