### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused, a 38-year-old male Chinese, Singapore citizen, was charged with the following:

(i)     276 charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat the Central Provident Fund Board (the “CPF Board”) by authorising the submission of various Medisave claims to the CPF Board, to deceive the CPF Board into believing that he had performed procedures on the various patients on the dates stated in the claims, when he had not in fact done so (“the cheating charges”); and

(ii)     two charges under section 468 read with section 109 of the Penal Code for engaging in a conspiracy to cheat the Ministry of Health during a Professional Medisave Audit on The Smile Division (“TSD”) by forging the clinical notes of two of his patients (“the forgery charges”).

2       The Accused was represented and elected to plead guilty. The Prosecution proceeded on 28 cheating charges and both the forgery charges. The remaining 248 cheating charges were stood down.

3       Upon his conviction, the Prosecution applied for the remaining charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. On 3 May 2019, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

4       The sentences in DAC 935864-2018, DAC 935920-2018, DAC 936059-2018, DAC 936150-2018 and DAC 936181-2018 were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence is therefore 24 months’ imprisonment.

5       The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the sentence and filed an appeal against it. I now set out the reasons for the sentence meted out.

## (2)   The Pertinent Facts

#### Background

6       The pertinent portions of the Statement of Facts, which the Accused admitted to without qualification, are set out below.

7       The Accused graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2006 with a Bachelor’s Degree and practised as a dental surgeon after his graduation. From 2006 to 2008, the Accused practised at the National Dental Centre. He was with Vista Dental Surgery from 2008, and joined TSD sometime in 2011.

8       TSD was a group of dental surgery clinics, with each TSD clinic operating under a separate limited exempt private company. The sole shareholder and director of each of the TSD clinic was Dr Goh Chin Chye Cecil (“Goh”). TSD had a practice manager, Mdm Yeo Meow Koon (“Yeo”). Yeo was responsible for, _inter alia_, the “schedules of dentists and nurses” and the preparation and submission of “relevant documents on behalf of TSD’s patients for claims” made under the Central Provident Fund Medisave scheme[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). In addition, Yeo was responsible for the preparation of documents, in consultation with the relevant dentists, for auditing purposes.

9       At the time the offences were committed, TSD had nine dental clinics island-wide with about 30 dentists, working either full-time or part-time. The Accused and Dr Ang Kiam Hau Steven (“Ang”) were working full time at TSD at the material time.

10     During the time the Accused was with TSD, he was rostered to work at three of the dental clinics under TSD. The Accused was paid based on the fees collected from the patients: TSD would deduct and retain the costs incidental to the dental procedures performed/treatment rendered, and the Accused would then receive 50% of the balance. The Accused resigned from TSD in 2014[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

#### The Fraudulent Scheme

11     Sometime in 2009, Ang devised a scheme of making dishonest Medisave claims by certifying in Letters of Certification that dental procedures were performed on patients over numerous days, when that was not the case, with the intention of dishonestly inducing the CPF Board to disburse multiple claim amounts to TSD (the “Scheme”)[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

12     Claims that could be made from a CPF members’ Medisave accounts was regulated under the Central Provident Fund (Medisave Account Withdrawals) Regulations (the “Regulations”) and a patient was only to use his Medisave savings to pay for medical procedures carried out by an approved medical institution and an approved medical practitioner[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). Claims were further regulated in terms of the type of procedure for which claims could be made, the amount of each claim which could be made in relation to each procedure, and the number of claims that could be made within a particular day. The claims were generally capped[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). The Scheme essentially “split up” single procedures into “multiple procedures”, thereby circumventing the daily withdrawal limits under the Regulations[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

13     When Goh found out about the Scheme, he decided to implement the Scheme in the dental clinics under TSD. Through Yeo, Goh put in place a centralised system of processing and submitting dishonest Medisave claims made by the dental clinics, and also encouraged the dentists in TSD to adopt the Scheme[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7).

14     Liew came to know of the Scheme when he joined TSD, and participated in it. He knew that he would benefit from the Scheme since a patient would more likely choose dental procedures which did not require him to pay out-of-pocket[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). The Scheme required the patient to receive financial counselling from the staff of the relevant TSD dental clinic. Once the staff ascertained that the patient had sufficient savings in his CPF account, the patient would be advised that he would be able to utilise his savings to pay the full costs of his procedure through a “package” offered by TSD[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9).

15     If the patient was agreeable to using his CPF savings to pay for the full costs of his treatment, the Accused would proceed to perform the procedure on the patient. Multiple claims would then be made against the patient’s Medisave account through the Scheme. In order for the false claims to be made, the TSD staff would work out the number of Medisave claims and the type of “surgical procedures” to be assigned to these claims, so that the full costs of the procedure could be claimed. Fictitious surgery dates would also be assigned to these false claims, on which no surgery was in fact carried out, to circumvent the withdrawal limits imposed under the Regulations. A patient who agreed to the Scheme was required to sign on multiple blank Medisave Authorisation Forms and the Accused would also sign on an equivalent number of blank Letters of Certification to facilitate the making of false claims to the CPF Board[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10).

#### CAD Investigations

16     Sometime in September 2013, the CPF Board informed the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) that “there were inappropriate Medisave claims by some dental clinics. Subsequently, an audit was conducted and some irregularities were detected”. Based on the information received, the Medisave Dental Audit Team of MOH (“DAT”) conducted an ad-hoc Professional Medisave Audit, in November 2013, on a random sample of claims submitted by TSD. TSD was then requested to submit the following items, in relation to a patient treated at a TSD clinic, as part of the audit process:

a.     the patient’s full set of clinical notes;

b.     the Letter of Certification;

c.     the Medisave Authorisation Form;

d.     the pre- and post-surgery investigative reports, including radiographs, CT scan images, implant labels, histology reports etc.; and

e.     the payment records (_e.g._ invoices or receipts issued to the patient) showing the itemised breakdown of the bill submitted for Medisave claims[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

17     TSD provided the requisite documents to DAT, with a cover letter signed by Goh. By end-February 2014, DAT had completed its assessment and evaluation on the sample claims. It concluded that at least four Medisave claims were highly suspicious and might be fraudulent submissions. MOH eventually lodged a police report on 14 July 2014, informing the police of its suspicion that four dishonest claims were made by a TSD clinic at Choa Chu Kang for procedures which were supposedly performed by the Accused but which were in fact not carried out[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12).

18     Upon the lodging of the police report by MOH, CAD carried out extensive investigations and interviewed 36 patients, after limiting its investigations based on the following criteria:

a.     claims where the total amount claimed by the patient exceeded $30,000;

b.     claims submitted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013; and

c.     claims reflecting a date which ICA’s records showed that either the patient or the dentist was not in Singapore, when the treatment was purportedly rendered[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

19     False Medisave claims were found to be submitted on behalf of these patients, and investigations revealed that 13 of the 36 patients were treated by the Accused – these formed the subject-matter of the cheating charges against him. Ang was found to have treated 14 patients, and Goh was found to have treated nine patients[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

20     Of the 13 patients treated by the Accused, two of them were randomly selected by DAT for the Professional Medisave Audit. Forged clinical notes were submitted to DAT and these formed the subject-matter of the forgery charges against the Accused.

#### The Charges

21     Further investigations revealed that, between 2011 and 2013, the Accused engaged in a conspiracy with Goh and Yeo, to cheat the CPF Board in respect of Medisave claims made by six of the Accused’s patients by authorising the submission of false Medisave claims to deceive the CPF Board into believing that he had performed procedures on these patients on the dates stated in the claims, when he had not in fact done so. As a result of the deception, the CPF Board delivered various amounts to TSD. The particulars of the cheating charges are set out below:

22     For the above patients, the false Medisave claims had drained between 79.9% and 89.1% of the total amount in their Medisave accounts[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). Other than one patient, the remaining five patients did not incur any out-of-pocket expenses for the procedures performed by the Accused[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

23     Investigations also revealed that, on or around 30 October 2012, Yeo received a request from DAT for relevant documents in respect of one of the Accused’s patients, Mdm Jasbir Kaur d/o Hardial Singh, for the purpose of the Professional Medisave Audit. Yeo realised that the clinical notes for Mdm Kaur did not tally with the Medisave claims submitted. She notified the Accused, and both of them rewrote the clinical notes for Mdm Kaur. In addition, the Accused instructed Yeo look for a set of suitable radiographs taken for another patient to pass off as radiographs of Mdm Kaur, since there were no radiographs taken for her. The Accused did so to avoid detection by MOH of the dishonest claims filed by TSD in relation to Mdm Kaur (DAC 936181-2018)[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

24     A year later, on or around 8 November 2013, Yeo received another request from DAT for relevant documents in respect of Yeo Choon Tee, who was the Accused’s patient, for the purpose of the Professional Medisave Audit. Yeo realised, again, that the clinical notes for Mdm Yeo did not tally with the Medisave claims submitted. The Accused was notified, and both of them proceeded to rewrite the clinical notes for Mdm Yeo, to avoid detection by MOH of the dishonest claims filed by TSD in relation to Mdm Yeo (DAC 936182-2018)[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18).

25     On both occasions in 2012 and 2013, Goh signed off on the cover letter before the documents were submitted to DAT.

26     The total amount which was disbursed by the CPF Board as a result of the false Medisave claims made by the Accused was $388,700.00. The Accused made full restitution of the amount, including interest amounting to $81,474.49 on 21 December 2017[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19).

## (3)   The Sentence

27     An offence under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. The offender shall also be liable to a fine. The prescibed punishment is the same for an offence under section 468 read with section 109 of the Penal Code.

### (a)   Antecedents

28     The Accused has no antecedents.

### (b)   Prosecution’s position on sentence

29     The Prosecution submitted, that a global sentence of 30 to 36 months’ imprisonment would be fair and just as, _inter alia_:

(i)     the Accused’s fraud subverted the national healthcare policy;

(ii)     the fraud was perpetuated against public institutions;

(iii)     the offences involved abuse of trust and professional integrity;

(iv)     the offences were pre-meditated, highly planned and committed systematically over a prolonged period of time;

(v)     real and substantial harm was caused to the Accused’s patients;

(vi)     the Accused was motivated by significant personal gains; and

(vii)     the Accused’s plea of guilt and restitution should not be given significant weight.

### (c)   The mitigation plea

30     The Defence submitted for a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment. In its submissions, the Defence highlighted, _inter alia_:

(i)     the restitution made by the Accused and his remorse;

(ii)     the clang of the prison gates principle;

(iii)     the principle of parity in sentencing; and

(iv)     the principle of totality in sentencing.

### (d)   Decision on sentence

#### (i)   Sentencing precedents for cheating cases involving public institutions

31     As observed by the Prosecution in its Address on Sentence, “\[t\]his is a unique case, where a medical professional entrusted with making honest and accurate claims from a statutory trustee, abused that trust by cheating the trustee”[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). The Prosecution cited six cheating cases involving public institution and discussed them extensively[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21):

(i)      _PP v Lim Cheng Hoe_ (unreported, DAC 39357-2013) – the offender was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment;

(ii)      _PP v Lim May Cheng_ – the offender was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment;

(iii)      _Anil Kumar Singh s/o Ragu Singh v PP_ (unreported, MA 259-1995) – the offender was sentenced to a total of 60 months’ imprisonment;

(iv)      _PP v Zheng Zhenwei_ (unreported, DAC 923128-2017) – the offender was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment;

(v)      _Lim Mong Hong v PP_ – the offender was sentenced to a total of 16 months’ imprisonment; and

(vi)      _PP v Koh Seah Wee & Lim Chai Meng_ – Koh was sentenced to a total of 22 years’ imprisonment and Lim was sentenced to a total of 15 years’ imprisonment.

32     I agreed that the cases cited by the Prosecution were relevant. However, as I have noted in _PP v Ang Kiam Hau Steven_ (unreported, DAC 912271-2017 & ors), they were not on all fours with the present case[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). In the cases cited by the Prosecution, the deception of the offenders had resulted in actual losses to the government. This was quite apart from whether the government had actually suffered real losses after restitution being made by the offenders. In Ang’s case, the Prosecution had similarly proceeded against him on 30 charges. All the charges involved an amount of $2,150, except for one which was for an amount of $3,508. He was sentenced to a total of 30 months’ imprisonment – six months’ imprisonment on each of the cheating charges, with the sentences in five of the charges ordered to run consecutively.

#### (ii)   Sentencing precedents for forgery cases involving public institutions

33     In relation to the forgery charges, the Prosecution cited three cases and submitted that even where there was no financial benefit to the offenders, “offences of forgery for the purpose of cheating involving public agencies will always be treated seriously and met with stiff sentences”[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23):

_Lim Ek Kian v PP_

\[Claimed trial\]

The offender was the managing director of the distributor of Skoda cars in Singapore at the material time. The offender had forged the signature of the victim, who was one of his customers, on a LTA transfer form for the purpose of deceiving LTA into believing that the victim intended to transfer her PARF/COE rebate to one Jason, who was another customer of the offender. Based on the LTA transfer form, the victim’s rebate of $9,237 was transferred to Jason which was then used towards the payment of the registration charges for Jason’s car. Subsequently, Skoda terminated its distributorship with the offender’s company, and the victim lost, _inter alia_, the $9,237 which was wrongfully transferred to Jason, as a result of the offender’s forgery. No restitution was made.

The offender, who was traced for theft in 1987, claimed trial to the charge. He was convicted and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed.

_PP v Balasundaram s/o Suppiah_ (MA 71-2003)

\[Claimed trial\]

The offender was the operations manager for a night club and was responsible for obtaining a licence from the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit (“PELU”). An endorsement from the Fire Safety Bureau (“FSB”) was necessary as part of the application process. The endorsement by the FSB was for 146 patrons. However, the offender forged the endorsement by changing the number to 246 patrons before submitting the application to PELU which approved the application.

The offender was traced for various offences including cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code, and giving false information under section 26A of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The offender was convicted after a trial and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. His appeal was withdrawn.

_PP v Hew Chong Wai_ (unreported, DAC 916378-2017 & ors)

\[Pleaded guilty\]

The offender was a Housing and Maintenance Inspector of the Housing Development Board (“HDB”). Between February and March 1987, he forged signatures of HDB officers on 128 Work Orders to deceive HDB into believing that works had been completed. This was done to allow his accomplice to claim reimbursements from the HDB. The total value for the works was $66,612.05, with the offender’s share being $22,959.50. The offender absconded to Malaysia sometime in 1987, and was only arrested in May 2017.

The Prosecution proceeded on 18 charges against the offender, who was untraced. He was sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment on each of the charges, with a global sentence of 42 weeks’ imprisonment.

34     I next considered the sentencing factors raised by the Prosecution and the Defence’s mitigation plea.

#### (iii)   The sentencing factors raised by the Prosecution

### Accused’s fraud subverted national healthcare policy

35     I agreed that the Accused’s participation in the Scheme subverted our national healthcare policy. The restrictions in the Regulations for Medisave claims were meant, at a general level, to prevent the over depletion of a member’s Medisave account over time. For example, where multiple surgical procedures were performed on a patient on any given date, Medisave claims could only be made for no more than three such procedures, involving no more than two anatomical systems and no more than two procedures within each system, depending on the type of surgical procedures involved[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24).

36     As I noted in Ang’s case, the Scheme essentially “split up” single procedures into “multiple procedures” in order to circumvent the regulatory strictures and caps. How this was done vis-à-vis the patient was that the Accused’s staff would ask the patient to provide his Medisave Account status as part of financial counselling, and if the patient was agreeable to using his Medisave savings to pay for the procedure, he was offered a “package” that would, through the fraudulent claims, allow him to claim virtually the entire treatment in full from his Medisave account[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25). In the present case, the patients’ Medisave accounts were depleted up to 89.1%, and five of them paid for their treatments entirely through their Medisave accounts. The Accused participated fully in the Scheme for almost two years, knowing that he would benefit from it[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26), which resulted in an almost complete depletion of the patients’ Medisave accounts, a mischief that the Regulations were meant to guard against.

### Fraud perpetuated against public institutions, and involved abuse of trust and professional integrity

37     The Prosecution further submitted that the Accused “occupied a position of trust vis-à-vis the \[CPF Board\]”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27), and had abused that trust. I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused abused the trust placed in him as a professional vis-à-vis the CPF Board as he was expected to declare truthfully the treatments which were given to the patients, and not make fictitious submissions to it. The Accused’s offences were further aggravated[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) by the fact that he perpetuated the fraud not just against the CPF Board, but also MOH, when he sought to cover up the false claims by conspiring with Yeo to forge clinical notes of two of his patients.

38     As pointed out by the Prosecution, the audit check by DAT was a “mechanism” which was “put in place by the MOH to check errant Medisave claims”. The Accused and Yeo thwarted this safeguard when they rewrote the original clinical notes of patients, giving the false impression that the Medisave claims submitted by TSD were in order. Rewriting clinical notes goes against the fundamental duty of the Accused as a physician. A significant term of imprisonment is therefore necessary to signal the seriousness of the forgeries committed by the Accused, in conspiracy with Yeo. As a professional, the Accused was expected to submit genuine clinical notes of patients prepared by him and had abused the trust reposed on him. The cover-up by the Accused in October 2012 would have misled MOH into thinking that the Medisave claims submitted were in order, and allowed TSD to perpetuate the fraud against CPF for another year.

### Offences were premeditated, highly planned, committed over a prolonged period and Accused was motivated by significant personal gains

39     When the Accused joined TSD in 2011, the Scheme was already implemented throughout TSD “in a streamlined and efficient manner”. By the time the Accused participated in the Scheme, Goh had put in place a “well-oiled” system which was functioning “so smoothly that the \[Accused\] could simply sign stacks of blank \[LOCs\] and his clinical staff would simply take as many blank LOCs as were necessary to make up the entire treatment amount”[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29).

40     I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences were premeditated and highly planned. The Accused repeatedly participated in the Scheme for a substantial period of time, from 2011 to 2013, and his actions were not borne out of a moment of indiscretion. In terms of the cheating charges therefore, while Ang’s culpability was higher than the Accused, the Accused’s sentence for the cheating charges should nonetheless be higher than the general sentence for a section 420 offence to reflect the gravity of his offences[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30).

41     In terms of personal gains, the Accused was working on a commission basis. While there were no actual figures in terms of dollars and cents on the amount which the Accused had profited from the Scheme, it could be inferred that there were significant personal gains considering the fact that he was involved in it for the whole of his duration at TSD.

### Real and substantial harm caused, and Accused’s plea of guilt and restitution

42     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused knew that his patients were “not in a financial position to afford the dental treatments he was offering”, yet “proceeded to charge them tens of thousands of dollars for their dental treatment” thereby draining their Medisave accounts and leaving them with “a minute fraction of their savings for future medical needs”[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31).

43     While it might be true that the procedures were expensive, there was no indication that the patients were coerced or misled into accepting the treatment options presented to them by the Accused, nor was there suggestion that the Accused had deliberately recommended expensive treatments for the patients that were not necessary. As I have noted in Ang’s case, the patient should have realised that some improper conduct was afoot – the fact that they had to sign multiple blank forms ought to have put them on notice[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32). The disbursements by the CPF Board were therefore done with the consent and knowledge of the patients for their moneys to be utilised to pay for the dental treatments they were receiving from the Accused.

44     In the present case, the Accused had paid back the full amount, including interest, to the CPF Board. The Medisave accounts of these patients were therefore restored to their original state and no harm was caused to the patients in the end. In fact, they ended up paying very little for the treatments. It was also not disputed by the Prosecution that the patients had benefitted from the treatment. I therefore gave due weight to the fact that the Accused had made full restitution. If the Accused had not done so, the CPF Board would have to take steps to claw back the amounts, which would have led to uncertainties – this is especially so as the Accused is presently an undischarged bankrupt, and it is not certain if the patients’ Medisave accounts could be reinstated if the Accused had not voluntarily made full restitution.

45     As for the Accused’s plea of guilty, I agreed that it should not carry overriding weight as the evidence against him was overwhelming. However, I accorded some weight to it as a potentially lengthy trial was averted as a result of his plea. A trial would further delay the acquisition of a court order for the repayment of moneys into the patients’ Medisave accounts, if restitution had not been made.

46     I next considered the mitigating factors raised by the Defence.

#### (iv)   The mitigating factors raised by the Defence

### Restitution made and Accused’s remorse

47     As indicated above, I gave due weight to the fact that the Accused had made full restitution, thereby completely reinstating the patients’ Medisave accounts to their original state. I also explained that while I accepted that the Accused’s had pleaded guilty thereby demonstrating his remorse, this should not be given overriding weight.

### Clang of Prison Gates principle

48     I gave considerable weight to the fact that the Accused was a first-time offender, and had contributed significantly to Singapore in the past as a National swimmer. He is most likely to have lost his livelihood as a dentist, and would have to live with the stigma of a substantial prison sentence. From the podium of pre-eminence, his fall from grace was phenomenal.

### Principle of parity in sentencing

49     I indicated in \[40\] above that Ang’s culpability was higher than the Accused. Ang was the one who came up with the Scheme in 2009 which was then adopted by Goh across all the clinics under TSD. Ang’s offences also involved a higher amount and he faced more charges. When CAD conducted its investigations, the investigations were limited to claims submitted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013. While Ang’s charges were for offences limited to that period, it could be inferred that his involvement in the Scheme was from 2009, and therefore far more extensive than the Accused’s. That must be so as by 2011, Goh had already “franchised” the Scheme across TSD, having seen how successful it was.

50     However, this is not to say that the Accused was a blind follower, as he had participated in the Scheme for a substantial period of time. He was also not a young offender, was highly educated and had worked in both the public and private sectors before joining TSD at 29 years of age. Therefore, while I agreed that the Accused’s sentence should be adjusted downwards vis-à-vis the sentence imposed on Ang, it should nonetheless reflect the gravity of his transgressions, and a sentence of 3-4 months’ imprisonment on each of the cheating charges was, in my view appropriate: a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for each of the charges involving an amount of $2,150, and a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the remaining charges involving an amount of $1,550 or less.

51     As for the forgery charges, they were committed a year apart, in end 2012 and end 2013. The Accused had a chance to come clean in October 2012 when he was approached by Yeo who had received a request from DAT. DAT had provided a list of patients and requested for relevant documents in relation to these patients as part of its audit checks. One of the Accused’s patients was on the list. Instead of acknowledging that he had done wrong, the Accused worked with Yeo to rewrite the clinical notes for the patient, to cover up the inconsistencies between the original clinical notes of the patient and the Medisave claims which were submitted.

52     Even after the audit check, the Accused did not stop his dishonest practice. He continued with the Scheme. In end 2013, the Accused had another chance to come clean – he was approached by Yeo again for another request from DAT. However, the Accused again chose to work with Yeo to rewrite the clinical notes of this other patient so that MOH would not be alerted to the fact that there were in fact discrepancies between the original clinical notes and the Medisave claims.

53     Ang did not face forgery charges, and I was unable to agree with the Defence that the forgery offences were an “inevitable consequence” of the fraudulent scheme of TSD[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) and that the Accused had “no way out”[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34). While the Accused might have perceived himself as not having any way out in October 2012, he could have stopped participating in the Scheme after the October 2012 audit. He did not do so. Of the 278 cheating charges, more than 200 were committed post October 2012. In any event, the perception of him not having a way out could not be a factor which lowered the Accused’s culpability for the offences.

54     In deciding the appropriate sentence for the forgery charges, I took into consideration the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution, in particular, _Lim Ek Kian v PP_ and _PP v Balasundaram s/o Suppiah[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)_. In those cases, the offenders were sentenced to 12 and 15 months’ imprisonment respectively. Both of them were traced with dishonesty-related offences, and had claimed trial. In the present case, the Accused was a first-time offender, had pleaded guilty to the charges and made full restitution. Taking these into account and the other mitigating factors discussed above, I was of the view that a 9-month imprisonment term on each of the forgery charges was appropriate and would reflect the seriousness of his actions. A sentence of nine months would not be out of line with the case of _PP v Hew Chong Wai_[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36), cited by the Prosecution. In that case, the offender was on the run for 30 years, made no restitution and was sentenced to a total term of 42 weeks’ imprisonment.

### Principle of totality in sentencing

55     I have dealt at length the individual sentence which I considered appropriate for the cheating and forgery charges. In relation to the number of consecutive terms and the appropriate global sentence, I found guidance in the case of _Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v PP_ :

22    Having determined the individual sentence for each charge, the next stage is for the court to consider whether they should run consecutively or concurrently. In our judgment, the Judge was correct in ordering all three sentences to run consecutively. First, s307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012Rev Ed) provides that where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least two offences to run consecutively. Second, the possession charge relates to a separate transaction which took place about a month prior to the rape and house-breaking offences. Third, although the latter two offences were temporally proximate, the offences of rape and house-breaking violate different legally-protected interests and should not be regarded as being part of a single transaction: _Chang Kar Meng_ (\[16\] _supra_) at \[62\]; _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ (“_Shouffee_”) at \[33\]. _Distinct offences should be punished separately with consecutive sentences so as to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated. Otherwise, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending_: _Raveen_ (\[17\] supra) at \[41\]–\[46\].

23     _At this stage of the analysis, the court must consider whether the cumulative sentence is proportionate to the overall criminality of the offences by applying the totality principle_. The principle has two limbs: _first, to examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed_, and _second, to examine whether the effect of the aggregate sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences_: _Shouffee_ at \[58\]–\[59\]; _Raveen_ at \[73\].

24    The sentencing court must also bear in mind the aggregation principle referred to in _Raveen_ at \[77\]–\[80\], which is that the totality principle should ordinarily apply with greater force in cases that involve longer aggregate sentences. The aggregation principle recognises the fact that aggregation in such cases may result in a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the overall criminality of the case, and that longer sentences may induce feelings of hopelessness that destroy the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration. …

\[emphasis added\]

56     In Ang’s case, I ordered the sentences in five of the charges to run consecutively. Having regard to the above case and the principles in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ , I saw no reason to depart from my decision in Ang’s case in ordering five of the sentences to run consecutively. I therefore ordered the sentences for four of the cheating charges, involving four different patients, to run consecutively. As for the forgery charges, they were of a different genre from the cheating charges and, in my view, it was appropriate to order the sentence for one of the forgery charges (DAC 936181-2018) to run consecutively to DAC 935864-2018. The total sentence is therefore 24 months’ imprisonment.

## (4)   Conclusion

57     In my view, a global sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment for the charges would adequately reflect the culpability of the Accused and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.
