### District Judge Seah Chi Ling:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, Goh Kok Tin Joyce, female, 18 years old (the “**Accused**”), pleaded guilty to the following two charges (the “**Proceeded Charges**”):

> (a)     DAC-923233-2019

> that you, on 17 December 2018 at about 2.00 am, at the void deck of Block 776 Yishun Avenue 2, Singapore, together with Goh Teck Sheng Vincent, Goh Jin An Daniel, Joben Tovi Lee, Chantel Francyn Poo Jia Min, and Ng Jun Siang, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Chermaine Toh and Muhd Farhan Bin Noor, and in the prosecution of this common object of the said unlawful assembly, violence was used by members of the said unlawful assembly, _to wit_, by punching and kicking the said Chermaine Toh and Muhd Farhan Bin Noor, and you have committed an offence punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> (b)     DAC 923105-2019

> that you, on 17 December 2018, at or about 5.30am, at the condominium known as “Suites@East Coast” located at No 171 East Coast Road, Singapore 455277, together with Loo Kheng Lin Calla Casablanca, Tew Sim Ru Alysa, Cheng Yoke Sum Corissa and Kyle Erica Tan Kai Li, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Yee Bee Ling, _to wit_, by punching, kicking and sitting on the back of the said Yee Bee Ling, causing her to suffer a fracture over her left nasal process, and you have thereby committed and offence punishable under Section 325 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       One charge of criminal intimidation committed on 17 December 2018 and punishable under Section 506 (second limb) of the Penal Code was taken into consideration (“**TIC**”) for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) without qualification and was convicted of the Proceeded Charges.

##### Probation and Reformative Training Suitability Reports

4       In view of the Accused’s age, I called for both a probation suitability report (“**Probation Report**”) and a reformative training report (“**RT Report**”), which were furnished on 2 January 2020 and 27 December 2019 respectively. The Accused was found to be _unsuitable_ for probation, but physically and mentally suitable for reformative training.

5       The Accused had during the social investigations carried out for the purposes of preparing the Probation Report requested not to be placed in a hostel. However, after having had sight of the Probation Report in which probation was not recommended, Defence Counsel intimated Accused’s willingness to comply with a residency requirement if that would sway the Probation Officer’s recommendations. I, therefore, directed the Probation Officer to prepare a supplementary probation report to consider if a term of hostel stay would affect the Probation Officer’s assessment of the Accused’s suitability for probation. By a supplementary probation report dated 27 February 2020 the (“**Supplementary Probation Report**”), the Probation Officer maintained her view that probation was not recommended for the Accused.

6       On 27 February 2020, I sentenced the Accused to reformative training with level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, which carries with it a minimum 12-month detention period. I set out the grounds of my decision below.

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

7       The material portions of the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) relating to the Proceeded Charges, which the Accused admitted to without any qualification, are summarised below:

> _DAC-923233-2019 (Rioting)_

> (a)      _The victims are (i) Chermaine Toh (“_ **_Chermaine_** _”), 17 years old, female; and (ii) Muhd Farhan Bin Noor (“Farhan”), 18 years old, male._

> (b)      _The witnesses are: (i) Aufa Imtiyaz Bin Irwan (“Irwan”), 19 years old, male; (ii) Lim Zheng Gang (“Zheng Gang”), 20 years old, male; (iii) Muhammad Syafiq Bin Johaidean (“Syafiq”), 14 years old, male; (iv) Muhammad Fitri Bin Abdul Aziz (“Fitri”), 19 years old, male._

> (c)      _The co-accused persons are: (i) Goh Teck Sheng (“Teck Sheng”), 26 years old, male; (ii) Goh Jin An Daniel (“Daniel”), 22 years old, male; (iii) Joben Tovi Lee (“Joben”), 14 years old, male; (iv) Chantel Francyn Poo Jia Min (“Chantel”), 17 years old, female; (v) Renard Ong Wei Shan (“Renard”), 22 years old, male; and (vi) Ng Jun Siang (“Jun Siang”), 19 years old, male._

> (d)      _On 17 December 2018, at about 2.13am, the police received a phone call, stating that “A group of people is beating up a girl”. The location of the incident was given as Blk 776 Yishun Avenue 2, Singapore._

> (e)      _On 17 December 2018 at around 1.30am, Jun Siang spotted Chermaine, Farhan and the witnesses at the void deck of Blk 776 Yishun Avenue 2 and notified the Accused. Investigations revealed that the Accused bore grudges against Chermaine over relationship issues. Upon receiving the information, the Accused took a taxi to meet up with the rest of the co-accused persons, thus forming an unlawful assembly. The Accused and co-accused persons formed a common object to approach the victims and cause bodily hurt to the victims._

> (f)      _During the confrontation, the Accused punched Chermaine’s face, causing a scuffle to break out. The scuffle eventually stopped, and the Accused proceeded to reprimand Farhan for failing to act when his girlfriend, Chermaine, was being assaulted. Subsequently, Teck Sheng demanded that Farhan, Jermaine and all the witnesses leave the void deck, leaving Chermaine behind. All of them complied and headed to an opposite block._

> (g)      _The Accused then grabbed Chermaine’s face and pushed her head to the ground, forcing her to kneel, and bow or place her forehead onto the ground (also known as “kowtow” in colloquial Singaporean slang) to Daniel. The Accused then punched Chermaine on her lips before moving off. Chermaine suffered a cut on her lip and Farhan suffered bruising on his arms._

> _DAC-923105-2019 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt with common intention)_

> (h)      _The victim is one Yee Bei Ling, Jessica (“_ **_Jessica_** _”), 15 years old, female._

> (i)      _The co-accused persons are: (i) Loo Kheng Lin Calla Casablanca, (“Calla”), 16 years old, female; and (ii) Tew Sim Ru, Alysa, (“Alysa”), 17 years old, female; (iii) Cheng Yoke Sum Corissa, (“Corissa”), 15 years old, female; and (iv) Kyle Erica Tan Kai Li, (“Kaili”), 15 years old, female._

> (j)      _The witnesses are: (i) Raine Chong Yi Tong, (“Raine”), 15 years old, female; and (ii) Phan Thi Kieu My, (“Kieume”), 15 years old, female._

> (k)      _Investigations revealed that on 17 December 2018 at around 3.00am, the victim attended Raine’s birthday party together with Corissa and Kieume. The party was held at the barbeque pit of “Suites@East Coast”, a condominium located at No 171 East Coast Road, Singapore 455277 (the “_ **_Condominium_** _”)._

> (l)      _Raine posted a video on her Instagram Story of those present at her birthday party, which included the victim. The Accused, who was at Calla’s house together with Alysa and Kaili, saw the video._

> (m)      _The Accused and the victim worked as packers in the same firm. The Accused did not like the victim as she felt the latter was a slow and lazy worker._

> (n)      _The Accused and Raine texted over WhatsApp, and Raine told the Accused that she had heard people at the party talking about the Accused and the victim being on bad terms. When the Accused heard this, the Accused told Raine that she wanted to beat the victim up. The Accused instructed Raine to ensure that the victim remained at the party until the Accused arrived at the Condominium, and thereafter to invent a story to lure the victim to her. The Accused also related her intentions to Calla, Alysa and Kyle, and they decided to follow her._

> (o)      _The Accused then headed to the party to confront the victim. At around 5.30am on the same day, Raine led the victim to the swimming pool area where the Accused was waiting for her. The victim proceeded as told, together with Raine, Corissa and Kieume. Upon reaching the swimming pool, the victim realized that the Accused was together with Calla, Alysa and Kaili._

> (p)      _The Accused confronted the victim and began slapping the victim on the face. The Accused then grabbed the victim’s hair, punched her and pulled her to the ground, before using her elbows and knees to hit the victim. The co-accused persons also joined in, kicking and punching the victim. While the victim was face down on the floor, Calla, Corissa and Kaili proceeded to sit on her. The Accused again approached the victim, punched her on the face and kicked her head, before flicking her cigarette onto the victim’s neck area. The Accused and co-accused persons laughed at the victim while the victim was being sat on._

> (q)      _The entire group then moved to the back of the condominium to avoid the security guard who had been alerted by the noise. There, the Accused asked the victim to stand in front of a wall, before punching and pushing the victim’s head several times against the wall. Alysa then joined the Accused by grabbing the victim’s hair and banging the victim’s head against the wall several times. Alyssa also punched the victim’s face, causing the victim’s nose to bleed. Meanwhile, the Accused told Alysa to punch the victim harder. When Raine told the Accused to stop, the Accused said that it was not enough, and pushed Raine away. Then, the Accused and the co-accused persons punched and kicked the victim, even continuing to do so after the victim had fallen onto the floor._

> (r)      _The assault finally stopped as the victim was lying motionless on the floor with her face down. Corissa then said that the group should stop hitting the victim, but the Accused once again said that it was not enough. The Accused then pulled the victim to stand up and told the victim: “I will dig out your eye balls and put them in your bare hands. Then I’ll cut your nose off and dig out your intestine with my hands down your throat and any other organs I can grab. Then I’ll pluck off your nails one by one and skin you alive.”_

> (s)      _At this juncture, Raine’s mother was alerted of the incident and rushed down. The group lied to Raine’s mother that the victim was already badly injured when she arrived at the Condominium. Subsequently, Raine’s mother brought everyone up to Raine’s residence, where the victim’s injuries were washed._

> (t)      _The victim subsequently sought medical assistance at KK Women’s & Children’s Hospital (“KKH”). A KKH medical report dated 24 Dec 2018 stated that on examination of the victim, the following injuries were found:_

>> (i)        _Upper lip swelling and abrasion._

>> (ii)        _Hematoma on the left side of forehead and check._

>> (iii)        _Abrasions on the right side of neck – diagonal, the largest measuring around 4-5cm._

>> (iv)        _Circular burn 1x1cm on the right side of the neck, erythema._

>> (v)        _Abrasion and hematoma on the right elbow and both knees._

>> (vi)        _Tenderness over left and right temporal-mandibular joints (left and right jaw)._

>> (vii)        _Tenderness over the cervical vertebral (back of neck), left clavicle area (left collar bone), bilateral anterior aspect of shoulder and the right medial scapula (right back)._

>> (viii)        _Bruising and tenderness over hemi-pelvis proximal to right greater trochanter (pelvis and right thigh area)._

>> (ix)        _Bruising and tenderness over left-hand dorsum around the second metacarpal (back of left hand near to the second finger)._

> (u)      _The victim was also examined using a Computer Tomography (CT) and was found to have suffered a fracture over her left nasal process. The victim was subsequently referred to the plastic surgeon and dentist for her injuries. The victim was given around 2 weeks of medical leave, subject to extension by the referred subspecialty teams_

## ANTECEDENTS

8       The Accused is untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

9       The Prosecution submitted that the court should sentence the Accused to reformative training in line with the recommendations contained in the RT Report. The Prosecution highlighted the following factors: (a) the offences committed by the Accused, which involved rioting charges and violent assaults on the victims, were serious offences; (b) the Accused initiated both assaults; and (c) the manner of the attack of the victims, in particular Jessica, was persistent and relentless. The Prosecution further noted that the Probation Report indicated that probation was not a suitable option for the Accused. In particular, the permissive parenting style of the Accused’s parents was noted as an area of concern in both the Probation Report and the RT Report. Even when the option of probation in a hostel setting was considered, the Probation Officer reported that no hostel was prepared to accept the Accused due to her propensity for violence and lack of insight into her violent behaviour[^1]. The Accused would therefore benefit from rehabilitation in a more rigorous and structured environment, and should be sentenced to reformative training.

## MITIGATION PLEA AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY DEFENCE

10     In a written plea-in-mitigation, Defence Counsel emphasised that the Accused had been fully cooperative during the police investigations, as evidenced from the police statements and other information willingly furnished by the Accused to aid the investigation efforts. She was further only 17 years old at the time of the offence, and had no antecedents. It was submitted that because of her young age, the Accused was vulnerable or susceptive to negative influences. She had mixed with bad company, which led her to commit the offences. The Accused was deeply remorseful of her actions and had timeously entered into a plea of guilt.

11     In his further sentencing submissions in court, Defence Counsel highlighted, that the Accused had in the last few months been trying her best to change and turn over a new leaf, and that her parents could attest to that fact. Counsel submitted that the court could place the Accused on probation even though probation was not recommended. Counsel urged the court to “temper justice with compassion”, and sentence the Accused to probation.

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

12     The law takes a presumptive view that when sentencing youthful offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is one of rehabilitation. This is justified based on the retrospective rationale and the prospective rationale which underlie the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offences. The threshold age in determining the applicability of the said rationales is generally set at 21 years of age: see _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik_”) at \[33\], \[34\] and \[37\].

13     That rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration for youthful offenders is but a presumptive starting point. It is clear from case law that the sentencing of youthful offenders will be approached based on the following two-stage enquiry: see _Karthik_ at \[64\] citing _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[33\] (“_Boaz Koh_”).

14     At the first stage, the court is concerned with identifying and prioritising the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youthful offender in question having regard to all the circumstances of the case. The focus of the inquiry is whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix, or whether its primacy has been diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution: see _Karthik_ at \[65\]. At the first stage, it is often necessary to consider whether there is a need to incorporate a sufficient element of deterrence within the overarching focus on the goal of rehabilitation: see _Boaz Koh_ at \[39\].

15     In the _second stage_ of the inquiry, the focus lies in selecting the appropriate sentence that would best meet the sentencing considerations that have been identified and prioritised: see _Karthik_ at \[67\]. In cases involving young offenders, the sentencing options that give dominant consideration to the principle of rehabilitation are, in the main, probation or reformation training orders. The fact that rehabilitation is a dominant consideration does not invariably mean that a probation order should be made: see _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> (“_Al-Ansari”_) at \[63\] and \[66\]. Reformative training functions equally well to advance the dominant principle of rehabilitation, and indeed, represents a better balance where there is a need for both rehabilitation and deterrence: see _Al-Ansari_ at \[65\]. The key is thus to find the most appropriate sentencing option which gives effect to the dominant principle of rehabilitation, which is also balanced against the need for deterrence that might arise for particular offences: see _Al-Ansari_ at \[66\].

16     In determining the balance to be struck between the dominant consideration of rehabilitation and the need for deterrence, the courts must pay attention to the specific facts and circumstances of each case. Rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration may have to be tempered with considerations of deterrence in cases such as the following (see _Karthik_ at \[65\]):

> (a)     where the offence is serious;

> (b)     where the harm caused is severe;

> (c)     where the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or

> (d)     where the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist.

17     As regards the last mentioned factor, when considering whether the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist, the court will in turn consider factors such as (see _Karthik_ at \[66\], citing _Leon Russel Francis v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 651</span>):

> (a)     the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation;

> (b)     the frequency and intensity of the offender’s wrongful activities;

> (c)     the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and

> (d)     the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits.

**Consideration of the factors under the** **_Karthik_** **analysis**

18     Applying the two-stage approach outlined above, I was of the view that rehabilitation remained an important sentencing consideration for the Accused. The Accused is only 18 years old as at the current date, and the retrospective and prospective rationales would therefore apply to her fully. The nature and circumstances of the offender and/or the offences were not of such a character as to rule out rehabilitation as an important sentencing consideration. However, applying the other factors, I found that general and specific deterrence were equally important considerations when sentencing the Accused. In coming to this determination, I considered the following.

#### Seriousness of the offence

19     First, I agree with the Prosecution that the offences which the accused pleaded guilty to are serious offences. In _Praveen s/o Krishann v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1300</span>, the High Court noted that “serious sexual crimes, … crimes involving _violence_, robbery, _rioting_ and drug offences, in particular those relating to trafficking” are _serious offences_ in which the “principles of rehabilitation may be outweighed by other considerations such as the need for general and specific deterrence and even retribution” _(emphasis added)_ (at \[28\]).

20     The three charges which the Accused faces – voluntarily causing grievous hurt with common intention, rioting, and criminal intimidation – fall within two of the aforementioned categories of offences which the courts would generally regard as serious offences. Clearly, considerations of general and specific deterrence would have to be considered within the overall sentencing matrix in the present case.

#### Severity of the Harm Caused

21     The Accused had personally inflicted harm on two victims here. The first victim’s (viz. Chermain’s) injuries were less severe, comprising a cut on her lips and bruises to her face and body.

22     The second victim (viz Jessica), however, suffered significantly more severe injuries, leading the Prosecution to prefer a section 325 charge (voluntarily causing grievous hurt ) against the accused. In relation to the second victim, the accused had slapped the victim on the face, and then “grabbed the victim’s hair, punched her and pulled her to the ground, before using her elbows and knees to hit the victim”. Despite the victim’s cries, the Accused and her accomplices continued to kick and punch the victim. When the security guard was alerted of the noise caused, the group moved to the back of the condominium where the Accused continued her assault of the victim, punching and pushing the victim’s head several times against a wall. The Accused and the co-accused persons thereafter punched and kicked the victim, and continued to do so after the victim had fallen onto the ground. As a result of the attack, the victim suffered swelling, abrasions, haematoma, bruising and/or tenderness over multiple parts of her body (including her lips, cheeks, jaw, neck, collar bone, elbow, hands, knees, shoulder, back and thigh): see paragraph 7(t) above. Most significantly, the victim suffered a fracture on her left nasal process.

23     In addition to the severe harm caused to the second victim, the Accused’s offending conduct was further aggravated by the fact she was the instigator of the assault. The second assault was committed within hours of the first assault, and was clearly premeditated. The Accused had learned from Raine that the second victim was at the party at the Condominium and had specifically asked Raine to ensure that the second victim remained at the Condominium until the Accused arrived, and thereafter to invent a story to lure the victim to her. The accused also rounded up Calla, Alysa and Kyle, and the four of them thereafter committed a _group assault_ on the second victim. The severity of the harm in the present case, and the circumstances and manner in which it was carried out, again brought to the fore considerations of general and specific deterrence.

#### Whether conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist

#### Strength of familial support and degree of family supervision

24     While the Accused appeared to share a close relationship with her parents, the support and supervision which her family could ultimately provide her to facilitate her rehabilitation in the community were, in my opinion, extremely weak or poor.

25     One of the key risk factors highlighted in both the Probation Report and the RT Report (collectively, the “**Reports**”) was the Accused’s parents’ permissive parenting style in their guidance of the Accused. Their inability to enforce boundaries with her was repeatedly noted in the Reports. Her father in particular was noted to have “seldom enforced boundaries when Joyce displayed misbehaviours in school or at home”[^2]. Her father was described in the Probation Report as being “very protective” of the Accused, and slow at ascribing fault to the Accused, taking instead the view that the Accused’s misbehaviours in school were “caused by the actions of others”[^3]. The Probation Officer observed that it was this permissive parenting approach that “\[might\] have contributed to \[the Accused\] developing maladaptive coping measures when she was unable to get what she wanted”[^4].

26     What was even more troubling was the Probation Officer’s observation that despite the parents’ acknowledgement that they had pampered the Accused when she was younger, they “_continued to display limited insight_ to how their permissive parenting might have resulted in \[the Accused’s\] misbehaviours”[^5]. The common observations regarding the permissive parenting style noted in both Reports do not bode well for the Accused’s rehabilitation in the community. Indeed, this was one the key reasons why probation was deemed unsuitable for the Accused[^6].

#### Frequency and intensity of the offender’s wrongful activities

27     The Probation Report narrated a picture of a young girl mired in misbehaviours since a young age. Her conduct in school was rated as poor, and her misbehaviours included “improper grooming, smoking, bullying, using vulgarities and threatening teachers, skipping lessons, sleeping in class, using her mobile phone in class, fighting, slapping a classmate and flipping a bowl of noodles at a school mate”[^7]. She was further issued with a warning by the police for criminal intimidation in 2017 after being involved in a verbal argument with her then boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend[^8]. Overall, the school reported her as a “challenging student \[who\] openly defied school rules, took matters into her own hands, and bullied and imposed her will on others”[^9]. The last-mentioned observation by her school report summed up, in large part, the conduct of the Accused in relation to the current offences.

#### Lack of genuine remorse and insight

28     The lack of genuine remorse demonstrated by the Accused in the present case also pointed to the necessity of incorporating elements of deterrence when sentencing the Accused.

29     Despite repeated assertions in the Mitigation Plea that the Accused was remorseful for her actions, her conduct during the social investigations and interviews showed otherwise. The Probation Report noted that the Accused had tried to minimise her role in the offences by stating that her actions were the result of instigation by the victims[^10]. The Accused stated to the Probation Officer that her actions were due to the victims having angered her, and that they therefore “deserved the beating”[^11]. Similarly, in the RT Report, the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist noted that while the Accused acknowledged the wrongfulness of actions, she only took “partial responsibility” for the offences, choosing to “attribute blame to the victims, \[her accomplices\] and the witnesses for contributing to the severity of the physical harm actually caused to the victims”[^12].

30     Another demonstration of her lack of contrition was evident from the vacillations in her accounts of the incidents. As noted in the Supplementary Probation Report, the Accused’s account of the index offences during the social investigations and interviews significantly differed from that set out in the SOF, which she had earlier admitted to without qualification. She informed the Probation Officer during social investigations that her peers were the main instigators of the offences, and that she had no thoughts of using violence prior to arriving at the scenes[^13]. This clearly contradicted the material portions of the SOF reproduced at paragraphs 7(n), (o), (p) and (q) above. While the Accused did retract these denials in court subsequently[^14], her attempts at providing a different account of the events to the Probation Officer so as to minimize her role in the index offences pointed to a lack of genuine remorse on her part.

#### Presence of other risk factors

#### Pro-violence attitudes and Lack of Insight

31     Other than already highlighted above, the Accused displayed other risk factors. In the Psychological Report dated 11 February 2020 prepared by the Senior Clinical Psychologist engaged by the Probation and Community Rehabilitation Service to assess the psychological dynamics underlying the Accused’s violent offending and risk of violent recidivism (the “**Psychological Report**”), it was noted that the Accused “_endorsed pro-violence attitudes_ (eg using violence to resolve interpersonal conflict) and tended to _externalise blame_ to her friends and victims, and had limited empathy and remorse. Even though \[the Accused\] expressed willingness to receive treatment, she was unable to articulate areas she could improve on to prevent future violence”[^15].

32     The Accused’s act of forcing the first victim to “_kowtow_” to her, and the words she uttered to the second victim – _viz. “I will dig out your eye balls and put them in your bare hands. Then I’ll cut your nose off and dig out your intestine with my hands down your throat and any other organs I can grab. Then I’ll pluck off your nails one by one and skin you alive_”[^16] – were further illustrative of her pro-violence proclivities and unbridled nature and character that are in serious need of reform.

33     The above concern is exacerbated by the Accused’s seeming lack of insight into her violent behaviour. One of the reasons cited by the Methodist Welfare Services Girls Residence, which refused to offer the Accused residency stay, was “her poor insight towards violence” despite receiving professional intervention for a number of years. In fact, when questioned about her past violent behaviour, the Accused refused to acknowledge her conduct as violent[^17]. Similarly, when asked about her school’s report of her involvement in incidents of interpersonal aggression, the Accused again denied engaging in them[^18]. All these showed a clear lack of insight into one of the major risk factors, namely her pro-violence attitude. Her risk of offending was thus assessed by the Probation Officer to be high[^19], and her risk of violent recidivism in the community was assessed to be moderate[^20].

#### Difficulty in regulating emotions

34     A further risk factor evident from the Reports was the Accused’s evident difficulties in regulating her emotions. In the RT Report, the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist assessed the Accused “to have difficulties managing frustration and tended to express her frustrations through self-harm or verbally aggressive means that sometimes turned physical”[^21]. Her account of the events indicated her sense of “permissiveness towards the use of violence _as a viable option to vent her frustrations_”[^22]. This was borne out by her statement to the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist, in which she stated she “needed to vent anger and \[the victims\] just happened to be there”[^23]. The Probation Report also noted her “poor emotional coping” and “frequent outbursts”, where she would “bang on doors or use vulgarities to express her frustration” [^24]. If such attitudes were not arrested, these defects in the Accused’s character could potentially spiral out of control and lead to the commission of more serious offences by the Accused in the future.

#### Absence of Constructive Engagement and Association with Negative Peers

35     Lastly, the Accused was also assessed as lacking constructive engagement. She is currently unemployed, and spends her leisure time in an unconstructive and unstructured manner, such as watching videos, and playing arcade and mobile games[^25]. She was assessed to have limited contact with pro-social peers, her main social circle comprising peers with criminal antecedents[^26]. This was yet another risk factor contributing to the Accused’s “high” risk of reoffending[^27].

## Conclusion on the two-stage inquiry

36     Having considered all the above factors, for the purposes of the first step of the _Karthik_ analysis, I am of the view that _while_ rehabilitation remains a dominant sentencing consideration given the Accused’s age, it was not the sole sentencing consideration impacted. The severity of the offences committed by the Accused, the extent of harm caused, her lack of effective family support and supervision, lack of genuine remorse, coupled with the other risk factors noted above, all pointed to deterrence (both general and specific) being a necessary concomitant sentencing consideration in the sentencing matrix.

37     Turning now to Step 2 of the _Karthik_ analysis. As previously mentioned, the Probation Officer had in the first Probation Report found probation to be unsuitable for the Accused due to the various risk factors noted above which would largely undermine the prospects of a successful rehabilitation in the community. Even when a Supplementary Probation Report was called for the Probation Officer to assess if probation with a residency requirement would increase the viability of probation, the Probation Officer opined that probation remained unsuitable.

38     It is trite law that the final sentencing decision on whether to grant probation or not lies within the exclusive remit of the court such that the court is not bound to accept a Probation Officer’s recommendations. However, the court would ordinarily be slow to depart from the recommendations contained in the Probation Report: see _Karthik_ at \[78\]-\[79\]. In the present case, I found no reasons to disagree or depart from the Probation Officer’s recommendation, which was the result of detailed social investigations and was further very well substantiated, including by way of a Psychological Report.

39     The RT Report, on the other hand, found the Accused to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo reformative training and has recommended for the Accused to undergo reformative training with level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, which would entail a minimum detention period of 12 months. This is due to the multiple needs the Accused has presented with, namely “in the areas of lack of prosocial companions, her management of frustration and unconstructive use of time”.[^28]

40     All things considered, I determined that a sentence of reformative training at level 2 intensity of rehabilitation as recommended in the RT Report should be imposed as it strikes the right balance between the twin needs of rehabilitation and deterrence necessitated in this case. The Accused’s rehabilitation would be optimised in a close and structured environment where the Accused can undergo a more comprehensive rehabilitative programme aimed at correcting and reshaping the Accused’s negative values and behavioural traits. Accordingly, I adopted the RT Report’s recommendation and sentenced the Accused to reformative training with level 2 intensity.

41     The Accused is dissatisfied with her sentence and has filed the present appeal against sentence. The Accused is currently out on bail pending appeal.
