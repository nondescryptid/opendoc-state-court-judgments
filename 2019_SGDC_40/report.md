\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9038/2019/01.\]

4 March 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       The Accused is a 57-year-old male Singaporean. He claimed trial to a charge of consuming monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug, without authorisation, which is an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”).

2       The essence of the charge reads

“You…are charged that you, on or about 12 March 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, monoacetylmorphine, without any authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act.”

3       His charge is also commonly known as a ‘LT-1’ (Long Term-1) charge because it attracts enhanced punishment under section 33A(1) of the MDA in light of his previous admission to a drug rehabilitation centre in 1993 for consumption of a controlled drug ( morphine), and his previous conviction in 1997 for an offence of consumption of a controlled drug (morphine). The Accused did not dispute the details of his previous antecedents, and his liability for enhanced punishment. These were also set out in his charge as follows:

“…..you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 26 May 1993, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under section 37(2) (b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for consumption of a controlled drug, _to wit_, morphine, which is a previous admission by virtue of section 33A(5)(c)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and were on 17 November 1997, in District Court No. 26, _vide_ DAC27096/97, convicted of an offence for consumption of a controlled drug, _to wit_, morphine, under section 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Rev Ed) and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date and is deemed to be a previous conviction for consumption of a specified drug by virtue of section 33A(5)(a)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and you are thereby liable to be punished under section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).”

4       For the trial, the Prosecution called 9 witnesses (including a rebuttal witness), while the Accused testified in his own defence. He also called a Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officer as his witness. In essence, the evidence adduced by the Prosecution consisted of:

(a)     A positive statement (P1) recorded under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) from the Accused. P1, which was his cautioned statement, was admitted into evidence after an ancillary hearing. In essence, in P1, the Accused admitted to the consumption of diamorphine.

(b)     Evidence of various CNB officers who were involved in the procurement of the Accused’s urine specimens in accordance with section 33 of the MDA. The urine specimens were then sealed and delivered to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis. The Accused did not challenge the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses that his urine specimens were properly procured and delivered to the HSA.

(c)     Evidence of two HSA analysts, who independently analysed the Accused’s urine specimens. Each analyst issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA, both of which confirmed that the Accused’s urine specimens contained monoacetylmorphine. Both analysts also stated in their certificates that the presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine specimen is a result of consumption of diamorphine. The Accused, however, refused to accept that monoacetylmorphine was a metabolite of diamorphine, or that monoacetylmorphine was found in his urine. He also denied consuming diamorphine, or any other controlled drug.

5       At the end of the hearing, and following a review of the evidence, the submissions of the Prosecution, and the submissions of the Accused, I was satisfied that the charge had been established beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted the Accused accordingly. I also sentenced him to an imprisonment sentence of five years and six months. As the Accused has appealed against his conviction and sentence, I now set out my detailed grounds of decision.

## (2)   The admissions made by the Accused in his cautioned statement (P1)

6       The first major piece of evidence put forward by the Prosecution was P1, a statement recorded from the Accused under section 23 of the CPC on 18 April 2018 at about 5:19pm by PW1 Senior Staff Sergeant Tan Shin Wee Thomas (“SSS Tan”).

7       P1, which comprised 4 sentences, reads:

“I plead for leniency and ask for a lighter sentence. My brother had committed suicide and I am very sad and I have depression. I admit that I have consumed heroin. I have only relapsed back to drug less than one month ago.”

8       The Accused initially disputed the admissibility of P1, and an ancillary hearing was held to determine whether this should be admitted into evidence.

9       In the course of the ancillary hearing, SSS Tan testified that he had recorded P1 from the Accused who had spoken in Mandarin. As P1 was a cautioned statement, the charge was read to the Accused in the sequence set out in the statement, followed by the statutory “Notice of Warning”. Following this, the Accused gave the contents of P1 in Mandarin, and SSS Tan recorded this in English. At the end of the statement recording, the statement was read back to the Accused in Mandarin, and the Accused was given an opportunity to make amendments but he declined to do so. The Accused also did not have any complaint or request, and was co-operative during the recording process. He also signed on each page of the statement and wrote his own NRIC number on the statement. No inducement, threat or promise was made to the Accused before or during the recording of the statement. Nor did he claim to have been subjected to oppression during the statement recording process.

10     SSS Tan stated that no interpreter was used as neither the Accused nor he had problems understanding each other. SSS Tan also described the Accused as looking okay during the statement recording process, and that the contents of P1 came from the Accused himself. SSS Tan confirmed that he did not know the Accused personally, nor did he have any previous dealing with him. He denied the Accused’s allegation that part of the contents of P1 was provided by SSS Tan, rather than from the Accused alone. SSS Tan also denied that he had mentioned the word “mitigation” to the Accused during the recording process.

11     When it was his turn to testify, the Accused admitted that there had been no threat, inducement or promise made to him, nor was he put under any form of oppression[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). However, he claimed that SSS Tan had told him that the statement was recorded for purposes of mitigation in court, although the Accused initially also said that he had not told SSS Tan anything during the statement recording. The Accused further claimed that SSS Tan’s Mandarin was not fluent, and added that some of his (the Accused’s) words were not recorded, before again claiming that he had not said anything to SSS Tan[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). In addition, the Accused said that he had signed on the statement because SSS Tan had told that it was a mitigation letter. Finally, the Accused said that if he had indeed consumed drugs, he would have absconded.

12     However, under cross-examination, the Accused admitted that the “Notice of Warning” on P1 had been read to him. Further, he had signed on P1 voluntarily, had written his own NRIC down, and that he had been informed (and understood) that he was facing a LT-1 charge with a minimum imprisonment term of 5 years’ imprisonment. While initially still insisting that he had never said to SSS Tan what was written down on P1, the Accused later admitted that he had told PW1 that his brother had committed suicide and that he was depressed[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). This was in fact what SSS Tan recorded in P1. Nevertheless, the Accused claimed that he had not stated the rest of what was written on P1. Specially, the Accused denied saying to SSS Tan the words “I plead for leniency and ask for a lighter sentence”, which appeared before the sentence about his brother committing suicide, nor had he allegedly said the sentences that appeared after this sentence (i.e. the words “I admit that I have consumed heroin. I have only elapsed back to drug less than one month ago”).

13     The Accused, however, admitted that he had not met SSS Tan prior to the recording of his statement, nor had they any prior dealings.

14     In light of the evidence from SSS Tan and the Accused, including the latter’s own admission on the stand that there was no threat, inducement or promise made to him, nor was there any oppression surrounding the making of the statement, it was clear that P1 was a voluntary statement that should be admitted into evidence. In addition, I was also satisfied that the contents of P1 came solely from the Accused. Simply put:

(a)     There was no reason for SSS Tan to falsely include the statement about the Accused’s brother’s suicide in between the incriminating admissions that the Accused had made about having consumed drugs, and also his plea for leniency. Clearly, the Accused, who admitted that he had informed SSS Tan about his brother’s suicide, had said all these other things to SSS Tan to explain why he had relapsed to consuming drugs, and possibly also to elicit some sympathy for his case. This explains the flow of the contents of P1.

(b)     There was also no dispute that SSS Tan and the Accused were strangers, who had no prior dealings. Thus, SSS Tan has no reason to frame the Accused, nor did the Accused’s evidence suggest any basis for SSS Tan to lie against him.

(c)     As for the Accused’s suggestion that SSS Tan had difficulty understanding the Mandarin spoken by the Accused, this was denied by SSS Tan. More importantly, from a perusal of P1, it was clear that SSS Tan had correctly interpreted and recorded the Accused’s account about his brother’s suicide. There was also nothing to indicate that he had any problem interpreting everything else that was said by the Accused.

(d)     The Accused had also signed below the statement, and had had an opportunity to read the statement and to understand its contents. Further, since the Accused had also been given an opportunity to amend his statement, and had declined to do so, I saw no reason to doubt the accuracy of what was recorded in P1. In other words, the Accused himself was apparently satisfied that the contents represented what he had wanted to say.

15     Thus, I was of the view that full weight should be given to the contents of P1.

## (3)   Procurement of the Accused’s urine specimens

16     PW2 Station Inspector Edmund Lim Chin Tat (“SI Edmund”) testified the Accused was arrested by a team of CNB officers at about 12.40 pm on the 12/3/2018, at the lift lobby of Block 3 Jalan Bukit Merah. This occurred after they had found the Accused looking suspicious as he had a “drug addict’s cutting” and demeanour, including having a shrunken face. The officers had screened the Accused and discovered that he had a history of drug offences. A bottle of Procodin was found in the Accused’s possession, together with the Accused’s mobile phone. The Accused was then brought back to Tanglin Police Division, together with his bottle of Procodin[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

17     According to PW3 Sergeant Loh Kok Kiang (“Sgt Loh”), the Accused was then escorted to the toilet to procure his urine specimen in a master bottle. The urine was then poured from the master bottle to two smaller bottles, and the remaining urine in the master bottle was siphoned into a test tube by the Instant Urine Test (IUT) operator, PW4 Staff Sergeant Tan Yan Ping (“SSgt Tan”), and then tested with the IUT machine. The two smaller bottles with the Accused’s urine were then temporarily sealed in a Ziploc bag and handed to the Accused. When the Accused’s urine was tested positive for benzopdiazepines and opiates using the IUT machine (see P5), the two smaller bottles were removed from the Ziploc bag and they were sealed with HSA labels bearing the Accused’s name, signature, NRIC number and the HSA marking number. Scotch tape was pasted on the HSA label. Sgt Loh said that it was not possible to open the two bottles without breaking the labels pasted on each bottle.

18     The two sealed bottles containing the Accused’s urine specimens were then given to the Accused for him to confirm that the urine specimens and labels were his. Thereafter, the Accused deposited them into a locked metal box from which they could not be removed by anyone except a HSA officer with the key to the box. The metal box was placed in a freezer in the IUT room. This metal box was subsequently delivered to HSA by PW5 Sergeant Muhammad Norjansher Shah bin Misnan (“Sgt Norjansher”). The entire chain of possession of the Accused’s urine specimens – throughout the procurement process up to their delivery to the HSA for analysis - was not challenged by the Accused.

## (4)   Analysis of the urine specimens and the operation of the MDA provisions

19     At the HSA, the two bottles containing the Accused’s urine specimens were independently analysed by two HSA analysts, PW7 Zhang Huifen Hannah (“Ms Zhang”) and PW8 Ong Han Hui Jordan (“Mr Ong”).

20     The two analysts testified that HSA had received bottles of the Accused’s urine specimens, and each of them had separately analysed a blue bottle, which was sealed with the Accused’s signature written on it. After analysis, the two analysts produced the following HSA certificates (P7 and P8 respectively) which were issued under section 16 of the MDA.

21     The certificates (P7 and P8), issued by Ms Zhang and Mr Ong respectively, set out the results of their separate analysis of the Accused’s urine specimens. In essence, they stated that the Accused’s urine specimens were found to contain monoacetylmorphine. In their certificates, the analysts also stated that monoacetylmorphine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA, and that the presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine is the result of consumption of diamorphine. Consistent with section 16 of the MDA, I admitted the certificates of the HSA analysts into evidence.

22     In his testimony, Mr Ong also explained that he had conducted a preparatory test and a subsequent confirmation test, and had sent his results to a senior analyst. This was done independently of Ms Zhang’s analysis which was also reviewed by the senior analyst. There were no issues with the review, and hence both of them had issued their respective certificates. Mr Ong explained that an issue would have been raised when the variance in both results crossed a 20% threshold but that this had not happened in this case.

23     In court, both analysts also stated that if someone had consumed monoacetylmorphine, this would also give rise to monoacetylmorphine in the urine, although the presence of monoacetylmorphine usually came from heroin or diamorphine, which degrades to monoacetylmorphine in a person’s body and is then detected in his urine[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

24     In addition, Ms Zhang also said that the monoacetylmorphine in the urine specimen could also be due to consumption of an exhibit which contains both diamorphine and monoacetylmorphine[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). Further, she stated that it is difficult to detect diamorphine in the urine as it this almost immediately metabolises into monoacetylmorphine. The latter, however, could be detected in the urine about 1 to 24 hours after consumption. The monoacetylmorphine would then further metabolise into morphine which could be detected in the urine about 1 to 3 days after consumption.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

25     Mr Ong also confirmed that aside from the consumption of diamorphine, the consumption of monoacetlymorphine itself could give rise to monoacetylmorphine in the urine. However, in terms of pharmaceutical products, he was not aware of any pharmaceutical product that contains monoacetylmorphine. [\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

26     Importantly, both Ms Zhang and Mr Ong also confirmed that consumption of Procodin would not give rise to monoacetylmorphine in the Accused’s urine. [\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

27     Based on the evidence adduced, it was clear that at the end of the Prosecution’s case, there was some evidence, not inherently incredible which, if accepted, would prove each and every element of the charge. The Accused was thus called upon to enter his defence.

## (5)   Evidence for the Defence

28     The Accused elected to give evidence. He also called a CNB officer, DW2 Staff Sergeant Ang Xin Wei (“SSgt Ang”), to testify for the Defence.

29     In essence, the Accused claimed that the HSA certificates showed that he had consumed two kinds of drugs. He also took issue with the testimonies of the HSA analysts that diamorphine had “become monoacetylmorphine”, which was detected in his urine specimens. He claimed that the analysts had not specified which drug he had consumed, and that “…. people are rarely being caught for monoacetylmorphine, even for capital punishment. It’s either---it’s for morphine and diamorphine. Their report does not show monoacetylmorphine.” [\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) In addition, the Accused denied having consumed any drug, and insisted that the last time he did so was in 1997. Further, the Accused said that if he had indeed consumed drugs, he would have pleaded guilty and not claimed trial. He was also unhappy that the CNB officers had arrested him and taken the Procodin found on him.

30     When asked whether he could suggest any reason why monoacetylmorphine was found in his urine specimens, the Accused was unable to explain, other than saying that he would not know how the HSA analysts had carried out their analysis. He added that “I’m not saying that they are wrong, or they are bad. I’ve never seen this drug before and neither have I consume it.”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) The Accused further argued that the analysts could not provide any proof to substantiate their conclusions, other than their own oral evidence. When specifically asked to elaborate on the nature of his disagreement with the analysts’ conclusions, the Accused could only say that “…the report is incorrect. That’s my basis….” and “There’s no point for me to say anything further.”[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

31     As for his cautioned statement (P1), the Accused stated that he had told SSS Tan about his brother’s suicide and about him (the Accused) feeling sad and having depression. This was what SSS Tan had written in P1. In addition, the Accused denied that he had told SSS Tan that he had consumed drugs. The Accused added that if he had indeed consumed drugs, he would not have gone for his urine test on 18th April 2018. As for his signature that appeared on P1, the Accused claimed that when P1 was handed to him by SSS Tan, it was folded and he (the Accused) had not read it when he signed it.

32     The Accused also claimed that while he was able to see, read and understand the four sentences that were recorded by SSS Tan in P1, which were allegedly his own words, he “did not pay attention to what was written” [\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). He insisted that of the four sentences, only the second sentence (“My brother had committed suicide and I’m very sad, I have a depression”), which was found in the middle of the entire paragraph, came from him. The Accused was, however, not able to say why SSS Tan had included the other three (incriminating) sentences in the same paragraph that allegedly did not come from the Accused. In addition, the Accused insisted that he was told to sign the statement, and he signed it accordingly[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14). Further, despite the fact that “Notice of Warning” in P1 had been read to him, the Accused admitted that he did not tell SSS Tan that he was innocent and that he did not consume monoacetylmorphine.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

33     The Accused also produced his long statement (D1) which was recorded by SSgt Ang, on 18th of April 2018, at about 11:00am. This was recorded about 5 hours before his cautioned statement P1 was recorded. In D1, there were references to two certificates that were shown to the Accused by SSgt Ang during the recording of D1. While the laboratory report number of one of the certificates recorded in D1 corresponded to the laboratory report (P7) issued by Ms Zhang, the laboratory number of the other certificate that was recorded by SSgt Ang in D1 (“AT-1833-02741-002-01”), did not correspond with the laboratory number (“AT-1833-2488-002-01”) found on the HSA certificate (P8) produced by Mr Ong.

34     The Accused thus insisted on calling SSgt Ang to testify, as he claimed that someone had doctored his urine specimen that was analysed by HSA. In any event, the Accused said that for the certificates that SSgt Ang had shown to him when she was recording D1, he did not take note of the particulars written on the certificates. Instead, he only noticed that the certificates stated that “monoacetylmorphine was detected”. [\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

35     When SSgt Ang took the stand, she admitted that she had wrongly recorded the laboratory number of one of the certificates that she had shown to the Accused when she recorded D1. She testified that she had actually showed P7 and P8 to him when she recorded D1, and that there was in fact no certificate with laboratory number “1833-02741-002-01” even though this was the laboratory number of the certificate recorded on D1. SSgt Ang explained that there had been a typographical error in D1, in that she had wrongly recorded the laboratory number of one of the certificates that she had showed to the Accused as having laboratory number “1833-02741-002-01”.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

## (6)   Rebuttal evidence from PW9 Mr Muhd Thobraani Mohd Soom (“IO Thobraani”),

36     SSgt Ang’s evidence - that she had wrongly recorded the laboratory number of one of the certificates in D1 that she showed to the Accused - was corroborated by the evidence of the investigating officer, PW9 Mr Muhd Thobraani Mohd Soom (“IO Thobraani”). IO Thobraani confirmed that the certificate with the laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-002-01” that was recorded in D1 (which was purportedly shown by SSgt Ang to the Accused) does not even exist. [\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) Instead, there was only a HSA certificate with a laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-002-**03**” that had a similar reference number to “AT-1833-02741-002-**01**”. However, this certificate (with laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-002-**03**”) was actually issued for another accused person ‘Maula Bin Ibrahim’.

37     To corroborate his evidence, IO Thobraani produced two certificates, P9 and P10 which had been issued in connection with the urine tests for another accused person ‘Maula Bin Ibrahim’. P9 was the certificate with laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-001-**03**,” whilst P10 was the certificate with laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-002-**03**”. It is relevant to note that the two certificates (P9 and P10), which were issued for ‘Maula Bin Ibrahim’, had stated that methamphetamine (not “monoacetylmorphine”) was detected in the urine specimens.

## (7)   Decision on guilt

### (a)   Sections 16 and 22 of the MDA

38     Section 16 of the MDA reads:

“16.  A certificate purporting —

(_a_)    to be signed by —

(i)    an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority; or

(ii)   such other person as the Minister may, by notification in the _Gazette_, appoint; and

(_b_)    to relate to a controlled drug or controlled substance,

shall be admitted in evidence, in any proceedings for an offence under this Act, on its production by the prosecution without proof of signature and, until the contrary is proved, shall be proof of all matters contained therein.”

39     As noted by the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Mohammad Ashik_”) at \[37\], a section 16 certificate would be “…admissible in evidence to show that certain tests to detect the existence and quantity of specific drug(s) in an accused person’s urine specimen were done by the HSA. Such tests are capable of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the _existence and quantity_ of specified drug(s) in the accused person’s urine specimen (as opposing to proving the accused person’s consumption of such drug(s))”. \[emphasis added\]

40     The Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik_ went on to explain at \[44\] that _“..._to rebut the s 16 presumption, an accused person has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that a particular matter stated in a s 16 certificate is incorrect”.

41     In the present case, the HSA certificates (P7 and P8), separately issued by the two HSA analysts Ms Zhang and Mr Ong respectively, clearly indicated that the Accused’s urine specimens were found to contain monoacetylmorphine. This was their conclusion after conducting two independent sets of analysis. By virtue of s 16 of the MDA, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the certificates “shall be proof of all matters contained therein”.

42     Section 22 of the MDA further provides a presumption vis-à-vis section 8(b) of the MDA as follows:

“22.  If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).”

43     In turn, Section 31(4)(b) of the MDA states:

“…. each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for such purpose”.

44     Concerning the scope of this presumption, the words of Yong Pung How CJ in _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ at \[15\] (“_Cheng Siah Johnson_”) are instructive:

“I had previously in _Vadugaiah Mahendran v PP_ held that the statutory presumption in s 22 was twofold in that proof of the primary fact by the Prosecution, i.e. a controlled drug was found in the urine as a result of both urine tests in s 31, triggered the actus reus of consumption and the mens rea required for the offence. **The burden of proof hence fell upon the Defence who would have to disprove either element on a balance of probabilities. It was insufficient if the appellant merely raised a reasonable doubt.**” (emphasis added)

45     Similarly, the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik_ also affirmed the position that “…the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine specimens. **This means that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the s 8(b) offence are presumed by s 22...**[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)”. (emphasis added)

46     On the evidence adduced in court, I was satisfied that the analyses were carried out in compliance with section 31(4)(b) of the MDA in that:

(a)     Two parts of the Accused’s urine specimen were marked and sealed, and delivered by the CNB officers to HSA; and

(b)     The analyses on these two parts of the Accused’s urine specimen were then conducted by two different HSA analysts, namely Ms Zhang and Mr Ong.

47     Thus, since monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug was found in the two urine specimens of the Accused (as indicated in P7 and P8), by virtue of section 22 MDA, and in line with the decisions in _Cheng Siah Johnson_ and _Mohammad Ashik_, it was presumed that the Accused had consumed monoacetylmorphine and that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the offence in s 8(b) MDA were made out. Such a conclusion was also consistent with the evidence of the two analysts who testified.

48     The onus was then on the Accused to disprove either of these elements, on a balance of the probability, and not merely to raise a reasonable doubt.

### (b)   The Accused did not rebut the presumptions, and also admitted in P1 to the offence

49     On the evidence put forward by the Accused (see \[29\] and \[30\] above), the Accused was clearly not able to account for why monoacetylmorphine was detected in his urine. While he did not want to accept the results of the HSA analysis as set out in P7 and P8 (which indicated that monoacetylmorphine was detected), the Accused was not able to suggest how it was that both these analysts, who had conducted separate and independent analysis, and whose results were also checked by a senior analyst, could have both wrongly detected monoacetylmorphine in his urine specimens.

50     While the Accused submitted that Procodin could have caused the detection of monoacetylmorphine in his urine, it should be noted that he had not explicitly raised this claim when he testified (other than saying that Procodin would affect the result of his urine test). Specifically, the Accused did not make this claim when he was asked to comment on the analysts’ findings that monoacetylmorphine was detected in his urine (see \[30\] above).

51     In addition, this claim of the Accused’s was also not made in his cautioned statement (P1), which was the final statement that was recorded from him. This despite the fact that when recording P1, SSS Tan had read the “Notice of Warning” to the Accused, wherein he was specifically warned to state his defence. In such circumstances, the fact that the Accused did not mention in P1 his claim that Procodin was the source of monoacetylmorphine in his urine, made his eleventh hour claim even more unbelievable. All in all, the evidence clearly suggested that his claim, about Procodin being the cause of the monoacetylmorphine in his urine, was clearly a fabrication.

52     In any event, the clear evidence of the two HSA analysts was that consumption of Procodin would not have resulted in monoacetylmorphine being found in the Accused’s urine. Instead, they were unequivocal in their evidence that the detection of monoacetylmorphine in the latter’s urine meant that the Accused had consumed monoacetylmorphine or diamorphine/heroin which metabolised into monoacetylmorphine in the body. In addition, there was no other medication or substance found on the Accused, or produced by the Accused subsequently, which could have provided any alternative explanation for the monoacetylmorphine found in his urine.

53     Even the complaint by the Accused - concerning the erroneous laboratory number referred to by SSgt Ang in D1 - was of no assistance to him. The evidence of SSgt Ang, and that of IO Thobraani, clearly showed that what was shown to the Accused when SSgt Ang was recording the Accused’s statement D1, was actually P7 and P8 (the HSA certificates for the Accused indicating the detection of monoacetylmorphine in the Accused’s urine specimen), and not the certificate with the laboratory number “AT-1833-02741-002-01” (which was written in D1) since the later does not even exist. Neither was P9 or P10, the HSA certificates for ‘Maula Bin Ibrahim’ indicating the detection of methamphetamine in the latter’s urine specimen, what was shown to him when D1 was recorded.

54     Indeed, this conclusion was fortified by the Accused’s own evidence that the certificates that SSgt Ang had shown him when she was recording D1, stated that “monoacetylmorphine was detected”. In other words, it must have been P7 and P8 that were shown to him when D2 was recorded.

55     All in all, the Accused had clearly failed to rebut the s 22 MDA presumption. In other words, “…the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine specimens. This means that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the s 8(b) offence are presumed by s 22….” (see _Mohammad Ashik_ at \[10\]).

56     Separately, while I had also raised the issue with DPP Claire Poh concerning the fact that both the HSA analysts had stated that the detection of monoacetylmorphine in the Accused’s urine was the result of the Accused having consumed diamorphine, while the actual charge alleged that the Accused had consumed monoacetylmorphine, DPP Poh argued that this did not pose a problem in the present case. Her reasoning was that the word “consume”, in the context of the MDA, could not be taken to only relate to the drug that was actually ingested. In this respect, since metabolised products such as monoacetylmorphine are generally not found in pharmaceutical products in Singapore, but rather in the usual form of the morphine products such as diamorphine or heroin, but the Fourth Schedule of the MDA nonetheless includes such metabolite products in the list of “specified drugs”, she argued that Parliament must had intended that the scope of consumption charges involving metabolite drugs like monoacetylmorphine, cover not merely the act of ingesting monoacetylmorphine. Instead, they would also include the ingestion of diamorphine or morphine, which subsequently metabolised to monoacetylmorphine that is then detected in the urine specimen.

57     I agree with the logic of the DPP’s argument. In any event, in light of the operation of section 22 MDA, and the cases cited above, the detection of the monoacetylmorphine in the Accused’s urine, presumes that the mens rea and actus reus of the charge (of consumption of monoacetylmorphine) were made out. On that basis, and since the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption, the charge had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.

58     Finally, I would add that the Accused’s admissions in his cautioned statement (P1) to having consumed heroin, was also corroborative of his guilt. This is because, consistent with the approach advocated by the Prosecution, the evidence of the HSA analysts that heroin would metabolise to monoacetylmorphine in the body and be detected in the urine, would also support the charge against him. In any event, for completeness, I would add that diamorphine (the “source” of the monoacetylmorphine) is itself a specified drug set out in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA.

59     All in all, I was satisfied that the guilt of the Accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

## (8)   Sentencing Considerations

60     Following the finding of guilt, I had to consider the appropriate punishment.

### (a)   Prescribed punishments and the Accused’s antecedents

61     The prescribed punishment for an LT-1 charge of consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33A(2) MDA is as follows

(a)     Minimum: 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane

(b)     Maximum: 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane

62     The Accused has a total of 23 previous convictions, which started from 4/10/1976 all the way to 9/12/2013 (with another five other offences were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing on various occasions). In this regard, as regards his previous convictions, the Accused had committed a whole gamut of offences ranging from:

(a)     Gaming in public;

(b)     Drug offences like drug trafficking, drug possession (3 counts) and drug consumption (2 counts) and failure to report for urine test (6 counts);

(c)     Film related offences like possession of uncensored films and possession of obscene films; and

(d)     Property offences like theft (6 counts), theft-in-dwelling-house, fraudulent possession of property and dishonest misappropriation of property.

63     For his different offences, the Accused had been sentenced to various forms of punishments such as caning, imprisonment and fines on different occasions. So far as drug offences were concerned, his 12 previous convictions are set out below.

64     In addition, the Accused was placed under drug supervision for 24 months (2 years), on five separate occasions, and also committed to drug rehabilitation centres for drug consumption on three separate occasions.

### (b)   Prosecution’s submissions and mitigation

65     The DPP submitted that as the Accused had claimed trial, he should not enjoy the sentencing discount normally given to a person who had pleaded guilty. However, the DPP clarified that the Prosecution was not seeking an imprisonment sentence in lieu of caning.

66     When asked if he had anything to say in mitigation, the Accused insisted that he was not guilty of the charge for consumption of monoacetylmorphine, and continued to say that “I’m pleading not guilty.” He also did not say anything that was mitigating in nature.

## (9)   Decision on Sentence

67     In determining the sentence for the charge that the Accused had been convicted of after a trial, I took into account the following matters:

(a)     While the Accused was entitled to claim trial, I agreed with the DPP that he was not entitled to receive the same sentencing discount that an accused person, who had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and who had demonstrated remorse for this offence, would deserve. Effectively, this meant that the Accused should not receive the mandatory minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment, which would have been the usual sentence for an LT-1 offender who had pleaded guilty and had demonstrated remorse.

(b)     As for the specific drug consumption conviction and the specific DRC admission set out in the charge, I did not take these into account in sentencing as they were already the basis of the enhanced punishment for the LT-1 charge that he was convicted of. To do otherwise would amount to double counting.

(c)     That said, the Accused has many other drug antecedents, covering a range of different drug offences. He has also been sentenced to relative long imprisonment sentences, as well as been caned before (for his drug trafficking offence). Thus, beyond general deterrence that would usually apply for drug offences, specific deterrence was clearly also a relevant consideration in the present case. In other words, the fact that the Accused was a recalcitrant drug offender, who was involved in a whole range of different breaches of the MDA, and who had been punished (in various ways) for those offences, was not something that I could ignore.

(d)     Finally, there was nothing presented before me that was in any way mitigating. In fact, despite being given an opportunity to present his mitigation plea, the Accused chose to not make any effort to justify or ask for a lighter sentence. Essentially, he did not put forward any reason to suggest why he should receive any leniency in sentencing.

68     Moving on to the specific punishment, the possible sentence ranged from the mandatory minimum of 5 years up to a maximum of 7 years imprisonment, with a possibility of an additional term of imprisonment of up to 12 months imprisonment in lieu of the mandatory caning that could not be imposed because of his age.

69     In deciding on his sentence, I noted that many of the same factors that applied to the present Accused (see \[67\] above), were also considered in sentencing by the High Court in _Nandakishor s/o Raj Pat Ahir v PP_ (“_Nandakishor_”). While that case involved an offender who was convicted of an LT-2 consumption charge (also for consumption of monoacetylmorphine)[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20), the guidance provided by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) on the relevance of these same factors was nonetheless relevant to deciding the appropriate sentence in the present case. In this regard, in dismissing the appeal against sentence in _Nandakishor_, Tay J had stated at \[24\]:

“In my view, with the Appellant’s drug-related antecedents dating back to 1994 (when he was convicted by a military court) and in the absence of mitigating factors in his favour, it can hardly be said that an imprisonment term of six months above the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the MDA is manifestly excessive”.

70     In the present case, the Accused has an abysmal drug record, with numerous convictions for a whole range of different drug offences, and also various drug admissions and drug supervision orders. In fact, his drug-related antecedents stretched all the way back to 1981 (for drug trafficking and drug consumption). Further, the Accused had demonstrated no remorse and made no attempt to mitigate. In any event, it would appear that there was an “…absence of mitigating factors in his favour”. In the circumstances, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 5 years and 6 months was an appropriate sentence to impose.

71     In addition, upon a conviction on a LT-1 charge, an offender would normally have to be sentenced to mandatory caning of between three to six strokes, in addition to mandatory imprisonment. In the event that such caning could not be carried out, such as in the present case as the Accused was more than 50 years of age at the time of his sentencing, he could be subjected to additional imprisonment of up to 12 months in lieu of such caning (s 325(1)(b) and s 332(2)(b) of the CPC).

72     In this regard, in deciding whether to impose an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning, I was guided by the decision of the three-judge bench of the High Court in _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Amin bin Abdullah_”). The Court there had stated at \[58\] "…that an offender's term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to do so". This suggested that additional imprisonment should not normally be imposed. Thus, even for drug cases such as the present one, where there was clearly a pressing need for deterrence, having regard to the fact that I had already imposed a sentence of 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, I was of the view that any further enhancement of the imprisonment sentence to replace the possible lost deterrent effect of caning, would not be necessary (see \[69\] of _Amin bin Abdullah)._

73     Thus, the final sentence imposed was an imprisonment term of 5 years and 6 months. I also backdated this imprisonment sentence to 19 April 2018 which was his date of remand.

74     The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed against his conviction and sentence. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence.
