## Facts

4       The Accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

> **THE PARTIES INVOLVED**

> 1.    The accused is Khamalhan Kavnor Subramaniam, a 17 year old male Malaysian National bearing the Passport No. XXX, and FIN No. XXX.

HE WAS WEARING A WHITE SHIRT WITH THE NUMBERS “50”. WE TRIED TO GIVE CHASE, BUT LOST SIGHT OF HIM”. The incident location given is at Boon Keng MRT station, Singapore.

> **FACTS RELATING TO FIRST CHARGE (MAC-912200-2019)**

> 7.    On 16 December 2019, at about 6.13pm, the first victim went to \[address redacted\] and took lift B up to level 2. The accused who was earlier standing at the letterbox area took the same lift with her. The accused stood behind the first victim in the lift. No one else was in the lift at the material time.

> 8.    When the lift door opened at level 2, and as the first victim was exiting the lift, the accused used his left hand to swipe the first victim’s buttocks from the centre of her buttocks towards her right buttock.

> 9.    The first victim immediately turned around and shouted at the accused stating that she will call for the police. At this point in time, the accused was standing inside the lift while the first victim was standing outside the lift. The accused remained inside the lift as the door closed and exited the lift at level 8.

> 10.    The first victim felt angry shocked and scared, thus she did not report the matter to the police immediately. Later, at about 9pm, she met up with the complainant at the void deck of the said block and revealed to him about the incident.

> 11.    The accused admits to this offence.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did use criminal force to the first victim, intending to outrage the first victim’s modesty, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”).

> **FACTS RELATING TO THE THIRD CHARGE (MAC-912322-2019)**

> 15.    When the second victim was squatting to prune her plants, the accused ask her if her son had gone to work. The second victim told the accused that her son had gone to work. The accused than peeped into the second victim’s unit.

> 16.    Thereafter, the accused swiped his hand from her vagina backwards to her buttocks while she was squatting down. At the material time the second victim was wearing pants. The accused then fled to the lift lobby, while the second victim went into her unit to retrieve her mobile phone to call for police.

> 17.    The accused admits to this offence.

> 22.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did use criminal force to the third victim, intending to outrage the third victim’s modesty, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354(1) of the PC.

## Charge taken into consideration

5       The Accused admitted and consented to have the following charge for insulting the modesty of a woman be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing:

> MAC-900877-2020

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, on 16 December 2019, at or about 6.23pm, at \[address redacted\], Lift B, Singapore, did intend to insult the modesty of an unknown woman by making a gesture, and intending the gesture to intrude upon the privacy of the said unknown woman, _to wit_, by rubbing your penis against the said unknown woman’s buttocks, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Antecedents

6       The Accused was untraced.

## Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

7       Section 354(1) of the Penal Code provided for an imprisonment term which may extend to 2 years, or a fine, or caning, or any combination of such punishments.

8       However, in view of the Accused’s age at the time of the offence, both the Prosecution and the Defence were of the view that Reformative Training should be considered for the Accused, and asked that the Court call for a pre-sentence report to assess the Accused’s suitability for Reformative Training (“the report”).

9       I agreed with both parties’ views and called for the report accordingly.

### The Reformative Training Report

10     The Accused was found to be suitable for Reformative Training as he was of generally good physical condition, and of normal mental condition with no current indication of any major mental illness.[^1]

11     The report also stated that the Accused presented with multiple needs that required intervention, including in the areas of his alcohol misuse, sexual preoccupation, and attitudes supportive of sexual and violent offending. The report recommended that the Accused undergo Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, if he were to be sentenced to Reformative Training.[^2]

12     Some of the key findings in the report were as follows:

> (a)     The Accused was assessed to have lacked appropriate guidance, supervision and emotional support from his family since childhood. He reported having weak ties with his family, mainly only receiving financial support from his mother who worked in Singapore, while he resided in Malaysia. He had very infrequent contact with his mother and was either cared for by different relatives or placed in orphanages in Malaysia (from the age of 10 to 16). The Accused’s mother expressed that she had difficulties supervising and managing his behaviour in recent months and he had been rude and verbally aggressive towards her.

> (b)     The Accused had an unsatisfactory level of participation and interest in school and employment. He was expelled from school at age 14 and, for two years after his expulsion, neither attended school nor sought employment. In the month before his offences, he had registered to attend a technical college in Malaysia. However, he dropped out of school after attending classes for one week. He also did not have any feasible plans to seek further education or employment after serving his current sentence.

> (c)     The Accused’s main peer group comprised individuals from his gang as well as other peers who exerted an antisocial influence on him. He disclosed that in 2019, he frequently participated in fights together with his gang peers in Malaysia. He also had other peers with whom he often shared and viewed pornographic materials. He reported having parties where he and his friends would engage in risky sexual behaviour, including heavy alcohol use and having unprotected sex with multiple partners.

> (d)     The Accused had a pattern of chronic and heavy consumption of alcohol which was assessed to be linked to his offending behaviours. He disclosed that most of his use of violence (such as participating in gang-related fights) had occurred while under the influence of alcohol and said that he had drunk eight or nine cans of beer before committing the current sexual offences.

> (e)     The Accused engaged in few pro-social leisure and recreational activities. Aside from playing computer games with friends at internet cafes, he disclosed that he regularly participated in illegal street racing in Malaysia and made money from winning races.

> (f)     The Accused shared that in the past year, he had recurrent sexual thoughts and engaged in a high frequency of sexual behaviours. He would satisfy his sexual urges by engaging in pornography use, masturbation, and sex with multiple partners two to three times each day. He engaged in his current sexual offences partly because he was unable to satisfy his sexual urge with a consenting partner at the time. As a result, he sought to satisfy those urges by inappropriately touching his victims.

> (g)     The Accused also disclosed that in the past year, he had participated in gang fights up to four times per week, often leading to victims suffering serious injuries such as cuts that led to heavy bleeding and victims becoming unconscious.

> (h)     The Accused’s apparent need for a higher level of sensory stimulation and exposure to thrilling and novel experiences may lead him to engage in risky sexual behaviours which may increase his likelihood of sexual offending.

> (i)     The Accused had difficulty managing his anger and this had resulted in him being involved in reactive violence with both strangers and known members from other gangs. This was evidenced by his recent altercation while in prison, where he acknowledged that he had intended to beat up another prisoner who had shouted at him to shut up the previous evening.

> (j)     Overall, the Accused presented an antisocial orientation characterised by attitudes supportive of sexual and general violence, and with minimal insight into the factors that may elevate his risk for reoffending. Regarding his sexual offences, the Accused minimised the severity of his actions, opining that he did not cause any significant harm to his victims. While he was aware that his behaviour was illegal, he also perceived that he was justified to act out on his sexual urge because he was very sexually aroused at the time of the offence. Owing to his belief that his victims did not suffer any harm, he did not impress as having a sense of regret or remorse for his sexual offending behaviour. His permissive attitudes towards sexual offending may function to maintain his risk for sexual offending.

### Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

13     Having studied the RTC report, the Defence filed a written mitigation plea dated 18 May 2020.

14     The Defence highlighted that the Accused was a 17 year old Malaysian national who was resident in Malaysia. At the time of the offence, the Accused was visiting his mother who was employed in Singapore on a work permit.

15     The Defence referred to the case of _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> at \[28\] and submitted that where the accused person was a young offender who had committed a serious offence, the principles of rehabilitation and deterrence must form the prime focus of the court’s attention.

16     As the Accused was below the age of 21, the Defence submitted that the Court should start with the presumptive position that rehabilitation should be the dominant sentencing consideration, before proceeding to consider whether it was displaced by the circumstances of the offence. The Defence then referred to the case of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[30\] in which Sundaresh Menon CJ set out the circumstances under which the focus on rehabilitation may be diminished or eclipsed by the need for deterrence or retribution. These were instances where:

> (a)     the offence was serious;

> (b)     the harm caused was severe;

> (c)     the offender was hardened and recalcitrant; or

> (d)     the conditions did not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

17     The Defence then referred to the High Court judgement in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”) for guidance in ascertaining the gravity of an offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code using a two-step sentencing bands approach. The Defence submitted that all three outrage of modesty charges in the present case could be said to fall within the lower end of Band 2 or high end of Band 1 in the sentencing bands set out in _Kunasekaran_. This was because there was intrusion of the victim’s private parts but no skin-to-skin contact. The duration of contact for all three offences could be considered to be fleeting. The Defence submitted that the only other aggravating factor was that two of the incidents occurred inside a lift, which was an enclosed environment. Hence, overall, the Defence acknowledged that the Accused’s culpability could be said to fall under Band 2.

18     In mitigation, the Defence asked that credit be given to the Accused for his plea of guilt and submitted that the Accused at 17 years of age, was young and had failed to appreciate the consequences of his actions. The Accused was also lowly educated and raised in a broken family, which resulted in poor upbringing.

19     The Accused fully appreciated the gravity of his actions and pleaded for an opportunity to rehabilitate and correct the errors of his ways. He willingly accepted his sentence in the Reformative Training Centre and wished to put his time there to good use. The Accused admitted to his foolishness and was extremely remorseful for his actions and vowed that this would be his last ever brush with the law.

20     In conclusion, the Defence was grateful for the opportunity granted to the Accused for rehabilitation and the Accused fully accepted the term of 12 months’ of training in the Reformative Training Centre.

21     In Court, counsel for the Accused confirmed that he had gone through the report with the Accused and his mother, and reiterated that they accepted the recommendations therein.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

22     The Prosecution similarly urged the Court to sentence the Accused to undergo Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation in the Reformative Training Centre as recommended in the report.

23     The Prosecution highlighted four risk factors of concern, namely that the Accused was involved in a gang and engaged in fights, as well as his indulgence in under-aged alcohol consumption and recurrent sexual thoughts. In particular, the Prosecution referred the Court to the portions of the report which stated that the Accused minimised the severity of his actions, opining that he did not cause any significant harm to his victims and perceived that he was justified to act out his sexual urge; and that his permissive attitude towards sexual offending may function to maintain his risk for sexual offending.

### Decision on Sentence

24     In considering the appropriate sentence for the Accused, I was acutely mindful that the Accused was 17 years old at the time when he committed the offences. Although the offences could not be said to be minor as the accused had outraged the modesty of three different victims within the span of one day and intruded upon the private parts of the victims, albeit without skin-to-skin contact; nonetheless, in my view, the offences were _not_ of such gravity nor was such extensive harm caused to the victims to displace rehabilitation as the main sentencing consideration.

25     Turning to consider the rehabilitative sentencing options, I was of the view that probation would not be a viable option in the circumstances of this case as the Accused was ordinarily resident in Malaysia, and had committed the offences while visiting his mother who was employed in Singapore on a work permit. In any event, in view of the Accused’s various risk factors as highlighted in the report, as well as his weak family ties with his mother and her difficulties in supervising and managing his behaviour[^3], probation would not be a suitable choice in this case.

26     Hence, I agreed with both parties that Reformative Training would be more appropriate to meet the Accused’s rehabilitative needs. As highlighted in the report, the Accused presented with deep-seated issues that would require firm and targeted intervention. These included his association with gangs which perpetuated his risk for engaging in violence, his chronic and heavy use of alcohol from a young age which in turn fuelled his offending behaviour, his sexual preoccupation and high-risk sexual activities, as well as attitudes supportive of sexual and violent offending. Of particular concern to me was the Accused’s apparent lack of genuine regret or remorse for the offences he committed in this case, as demonstrated by him minimising the severity of his actions and the harm caused to the victims, and feeling justified to act on his sexual arousal.[^4]

27     As explained in Annex B of the report, all Reformative Trainees would undergo a series of interventions that target the Trainees’ motivation to change, their relationship with their families, and employment. In addition, for Trainees placed on Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation, they would undergo Psychology-based Correctional Programmes to address their criminogenic needs. The Trainees would also be offered vocational training or academic studies and intensive family programmes.

28     Indeed, having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the specific needs of the Accused, I was of the view that Level 2 intensity interventions at the Reformative Training Centre may well present the Accused with his best chance for rehabilitation, and hopefully turn his life around.

## Conclusion

29     I therefore sentenced the Accused to Reformative Training in a Reformative Training Centre for a minimum period of 12 months’ detention.
