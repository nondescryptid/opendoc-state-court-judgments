\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9752/202/01.\]

12 August 2020

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused was employed as a Sales and Service Co-ordinator by Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd (“Wartsila”). She pleaded guilty to eight counts of cheating pursuant to a conspiracy with Mohammed Sharul bin Shamon (‘Sharul’) and Ismadi bin Sinin (‘Ismadi’) under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008). She admitted to 18 similar counts and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

2       She has appealed against the sentence of 17 months’ imprisonment. The individual sentences are as follows:

## Summary of Facts

3       The accused was a Sales Co-ordinator with Cedervall Pte. Ltd. (‘Cedervall’) from 2006 to 2012. In 2013, Cedervall was acquired by Wartsila. Wartsila is a Finnish company which manufactures and services power sources and other equipment in the marine and energy markets. The accused then became an employee of Wartsila and became its Sales and Service Co-ordinator.

4       Sharul was a colleague of the accused. He was employed as a Sales Support Engineer in the Seals & Bearing Department. He had the authority to award purchase orders to vendors without having to go through the Procurement Department.

5       Sometime in 2013, Sharul and Ismadi decided to set up a company, Neigu Services Pte Ltd (“Neigu”) to make money by buying parts that Wartsila required from other vendors and re-selling to Wartsila at a mark-up. Sharul and Ismadi registered Neigu in Ismadi’s name as Sharul did not want anyone to discover the conflict of interest.

6       Based on Wartsila’s procurement policy, goods may only be purchased from approved vendors who have met Wartsila’s requirements. As such, Sharul deceived Wartsila by representing that Neigu was the new business name of an inactive approved vendor, Sea Hover, which was in Wartsila’s system. As a result of the deception, Neigu was accepted as an approved vendor.

7       The accused was in charge of managing the spare inventory previously kept by Cedervall (“the spare items”). These were items which the clients had ordered and paid for but did not collect. Although the spare items were not listed in Cedervall or Wartsila’s inventories, the accused was aware that these items were now considered as Wartsila’s property.

8       The accused conceived the idea of selling the spare items back to Wartsila. She discussed it with Sharul, and he suggested to use Neigu as the purported vendor. The accused, Sharul and Ismadi agreed to use Neigu to purportedly sell the spare items to Wartsila in order to deceive Wartsila that these items were from Neigu when it was in fact its own inventory. The agreement between the trio was that 90% of the profit made by Neigu in this manner would go to the accused, while the remaining 10% would be split equally between Sharul and Ismadi.

9       Between 2014 and 2016, pursuant to the conspiracy to cheat Wartsila, the accused raised Purchase Orders whenever Wartsila’s clients needed items which could be found amongst the spare items. The Purchase Orders were passed by Sharul to Ismadi. Thereafter, Ismadi issued false delivery orders and invoices to Wartsila which made it appear that Neigu had supplied the items to Wartsila. Investigations revealed that the accused, Sharul and Ismadi were involved in 26 false transactions between Wartsila and Neigu and dishonestly induced Wartsila to pay a total of $87,664.18 to Neigu. The eight transactions in the proceeded charges totalled $62,124.

10     After Neigu received payment from Wartsila for the items, Ismadi withdrew cash from Neigu’s bank account. He packed the accused’s share of the profit into an envelope, which Sharul then passed to the accused. The accused received her share of the profit in this manner over four to five occasions. The accused claimed that she received $20,958.46. She made full restitution of this sum.

## Address on Sentence

11     The prosecution sought individual sentences of eight months imprisonment on the three charges where the amount cheated was above $10,000. It was submitted that these three sentences should be ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 24 months’ imprisonment.

12     It was submitted that the accused’s culpability was not low as she had abused her position of authority; that the offending took place over two years; that she came up with the scheme to predominately benefit herself as 90 per cent of the profits were to go to her; and that the loss is significant. It was highlighted that the accused did not commit the offences out of financial necessity.

## Mitigation

13     The accused is aged 39 years old. She is married with four children aged 16, 15, 8 and 7 years old. They are schooling with the oldest being in secondary 4 and the youngest in primary 1.

14     She has no prior antecedent. It was submitted that the experience of being arrested, charged and prosecuted was punishment for her. It was said that the accused’s ‘basic good character’ is evidenced by her invaluable contribution to the Yellow Ribbon Project 2019. She participated in the GetActive! Singapore between 1 to 10 August 2019 and at the Sesame Street Run. She also volunteered her services at the Unlabelled Run 2019.

15     It was submitted that the accused had pleaded guilty to the charges which manifests her remorse and regret. The accused had fully co-operated during investigations and made restitution of the monies that she received. It was submitted that this further demonstrated her genuine remorse and it should therefore be given adequate consideration.

16     The accused came to know Sharul who was her senior when she joined Wartsila. Ismadi was introduced to her as the director of Neigu by Sharul in 2014 at Wartsila’s office. It was submitted that when the accused wanted to sell the spare items back to Wartsila, she approached Sharul and he suggested to her to use Neigu. He told her that Neigu was an approved vendor. The accused was unaware of the conspiracy between Sharul and Ismadi to misrepresent Neigu as the new name of an inactive approved vendor. The accused went along with the suggestion and raised the fraudulent Purchase Orders addressed to Neigu.

17     It was claimed that the accused spent a sum of $5,000 on office expenses, i.e. for stationery and tools, such as hand tools, safety helmets, et cetera, for the engineers.

18     The defence contended that the culpability of the accused is low and suggested an aggregate sentence of 10 months imprisonment. In support of the submission, two cases were cited. In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yam_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 42</span>, the offender faced five charges under s 420 of the Penal Code. The prosecution proceeded on two charges to which he claimed trial. The remaining three charges were stood down. The first charge stated that he deceived the victim into believing that $18,800 was needed as a tender deposit towards securing the contract for the development of 48 semi-detached houses. The second charge stated that the offender induced another victim to deliver a cashier’s order for $50,000 by deceiving him that he had been given special privileges for the purchase of two semi-detached houses. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and 12 months’ imprisonment respectively. Both sentences were ordered to run consecutively.

19     In _Public Prosecutor v Sim Wei Min Pauline_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 273</span>, the offender was a relationship manager with a finance company. She deceived the victim to part with a total of $210,000. She also forged documents to maintain the deception. She pleaded guilty on the fourth day of the trial to two counts of cheating under s 420 Penal Code and one count of forgery under s 465 Penal Code. Another four charges of cheating and two forgery charges were TICed. She made partial restitution of $150,000. She was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment for cheating $60,000 and to six months’ imprisonment for cheating $40,000. She was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for the forgery. The total sentence was 16 months’ imprisonment.

## Sentence

20     The offence under s 420 carries mandatory imprisonment. The maximum term is 10 years imprisonment.

21     The relevant sentencing objectives are general deterrence and retribution. In determining the sentence, the twin touchstones are harm and culpability.

### Harm

22     The harm in this case is represented by the amount that Wartsila was falsely induced to pay, which is $87,664.18. I noted that at the end of the day the loss to Wartsila stands at $66,705.72 as it has been reduced by the restitution made by the accused in the sum of $20,958.46.

### Culpability

23     As regards culpability, I noted the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The accused was the prime mover behind the commission of the offences;

> (b)     The large number of offences;

> (c)     The criminal conduct took place over a lengthy period;

> (d)     The accused’s actions were premeditated;

> (e)     The accused abused the trust of her employer.

24     These will be addressed in turn.

#### (a) The accused was the prime mover behind the commission of the offences

25     The accused admitted that she came up with the idea to sell the spare items back to Wartsila. She then broached the idea to Sharul who in turn suggested to use Neigu to perpetrate the deception. Whilst the accused was not aware of Sharul’s separate scheme with Ismadi relating to Neigu, this fact is irrelevant. The learned DPP stated that Sharul and Ismadi are facing separate charges relating to Neigu.

26     The accused admitted that the agreement was for her to receive 90 per cent of the proceeds. Whilst she only admitted to receiving $20,958.46, the fact of the matter is that the accused’s intent was to receive the lion’s share. As stated in _Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> at \[94\]:

> But I recognise that the _size of the promised reward_, or reward actually received, is a relevant factor in assessing culpability. Thus, the _potential to receive_, or actually having received, a very large reward can be considered aggravating. (emphasis added)

#### (b) Large number of offences

27     The fact that the accused committed a large number of offences is an aggravating factor. In _Public Prosecutor v Fernando Payagala Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Payagala_”), the High Court observed at \[46\]-\[48\]:

> As both a matter of common sense and general principle, it can be said that the larger the number of offences committed, the longer the custodial sentence.

> …

> To this, I would add that sentences meted out in serial cheating cases should not be only “slightly higher” as compared to that assigned to a single offender for the same quantum. The sentence could in the appropriate circumstances be significantly higher. A serial offender would be hard put to credibly submit that his conduct was the result of a momentary indiscretion.

28     In the instant case, there were 26 distinct false Purchase Orders raised when Wartsila’s clients needed items which could be found amongst the spare items.

#### (c) Lengthy period of criminal conduct

29     The length of time of an offender’s involvement is tied to the recalcitrance of the offender (see _Payagala_ at \[43\]). Here, the offending took place across two years. Learned counsel tried to lessen the culpability of the accused by submitting that the offending was not continuous over the course of the two years. Whilst that was indeed so, the fact remains that the accused had ample opportunity to desist from committing further offences but did not do so. Her offending took place between July 2014 to June 2016.

#### (d) The accused’s conduct was premeditated

30     It is evident that the accused’s offences were premeditated and deliberate. Whenever Wartsila’s clients needed items which could be found amongst the spare items, the accused would raise the Purchase Order which would then be passed on to Neigu through Sharul to make it appear that Neigu had supplied the items to Wartsila.

#### (e) The accused abused her employer’s trust

31     The accused was in charge of managing the spare inventory at Cedervall which Wartsila acquired. The accused exploited this position in order to perpetrate the deception.

32     Having regard to the factors above, I did not agree that the accused’s culpability was low. In my view, it fell within the moderate category.

## Mitigating Factors

33     As regards the personal mitigating factors, I noted in the accused’s favour her plea of guilt, cooperation in the course of investigations and the restitution made. I did not give weight to the accused’s clean record due to the multiple offences (see _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span>).

34     With respect to the contributions which she made to the community in 2019, without detracting from the value of the contributions made, I did not think there was service to the community in an exceptional way. I did not find it to have any bearing on the sentence. Similarly, the fact that the accused has four young children, has no mitigating value. The hardship to the children was an unavoidable consequence occasioned by the accused’s own criminal conduct and could not affect what would otherwise be the right sentence: _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> at \[11\].

35     As for the claim that the accused spent $5,000 on office stationery and tools, I did not regard this as a mitigating factor. In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Hoon Choon_ \[2000\] 1 SLR 221, where the offender had treated her friends and relatives using the money obtained by forgery, the High Court stated:

> Such an argument is unmeritorious as the respondent could not be given credit for acts of “generosity” carried out using money that did not belong to her and that she had in fact schemed to dishonestly obtain. It cannot be right for the courts to treat this as a mitigating factor in sentencing as to do so would in effect be to countenance such justifications which would undermine the purpose of laws relating to offences against property.

Similarly, the accused’s generosity towards her co-workers was not mitigatory. The monies which she cheated was not for her to use as she pleased.

## Sentencing precedents

36     With respect to the two decisions cited by the defence, for _PP v Lim Chee Yam_, the total sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was for two charges with the aggregate amount of $68,800. The sentence in the instant case of 17 months imprisonment which involved 26 offences against the same victim was in fact lower. As regards _Sim Wei Min Pauline_ who received 16 months’ imprisonment for her abuse of position and breach of trust and six separate counts of cheating relating to one victim and forgery. I also noted there was substantial restitution and the total loss of $60,000 was lower than that in the present case.

37     The precedents cited by the prosecution involved factual circumstances which were quite different from the instant case. Amongst the four precedents cited by the prosecution, the most relevant in terms of the amounts involved were the following two cases:

> (a)      _PP v Theresa Tan_ (SC-901942-2015)

>> Between 2010 and 2014, the offender falsely represented to various victims that she could obtain Apple electronic products at discounted prices or that she knew of profitable investment schemes which promised good returns. The victims were induced into delivering various sums to her. The four proceeded charges involved the sums of $4,480, $10,000, $3,960 and $2,750. In total, the offences involved the sum of $53,840. The offender made partial restitution of $4,200. She was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment on the charge involving the sum of $10,000 and to four months’ imprisonment on the remaining three charges. The total sentence was 11 months’ imprisonment.

> (b)     PP v _Goh Hwee Lay_ (DAC-500304-3013 & Ors)

>> The offender deceived the victims into believing that she had an investment opportunity to purchase Apple products below retail prices before on-selling to a buyer. For two of the proceeded charges, the victims were the offender’s friends. The three proceeded charges involved sums of $25,000, $10,400 and $21,000. Five similar cheating charges under s 420 were TICed. In total, the offender cheated the victims of $86,150. She made partial restitution of $12,245.50. The offender was sentenced to a total term of 20 months’ imprisonment (eight months’ imprisonment for the sum of $10,400, 12 months’ imprisonment for the remaining two charges).

38     Whilst the sentence in any given case is greatly dependent on the facts, the two cases show that the individual sentences which I calibrated were in fact lower based on the amounts involved.

## Consecutive sentences

39     As for the number of sentences to order to run consecutively, learned counsel urged me to order two sentences to run consecutively. The prosecution submitted that three sentences ought to run consecutively. I agreed with the prosecution.

40     There was a deliberate course of criminal behaviour over two years, and in my judgment the totality of the criminal offending was more appropriately encompassed in three consecutive sentences. Taking a ‘last look’ at the aggregate sentence of 17 months’ imprisonment, I found it to be just and proportionate.
