### District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal filed by the plaintiff against the decision of the learned deputy registrar (“the deputy registrar”) made at the assessment of damages of this case. The assessment was in respect of personal injury and property damage suffered by the plaintiff following a road traffic accident involving the plaintiff and the defendant. The appeal is centred on the issue of mitigation of damages. The issue in turn gives rise to the question of when it would be considered reasonable for a plaintiff in a personal injuries case to delay pursuing medical treatment. Medical treatment is one of two areas arising out of personal injuries cases which frequently gives rise to arguments over mitigation of damages, the other being loss of earnings.

2       The plaintiff was riding a motorcycle when the accident occurred. He was thrown off the motorcycle and suffered a fracture in his right hip and an intra-articular fracture in each of his wrists. The parties reached agreement on all heads of claim for property damage and some heads of claim for personal injury. At 100% liability, the quantum of these agreed heads of claim totalled $97,536.98. The heads of claim that proceeded for assessment of damages were:

> (a)     pain and suffering for the fractures to both wrists;

> (b)     future medical expenses for the fractures to both wrists; and

> (c)     future medical expenses for the hip injury.

3       The injuries to the wrists and hip were as follows:[^1]

> (a)     Left wrist – intra-articular fracture with long segment of comminution over metaphysis and proximal radial shaft. Malunion of the left distal radius joint with osteoarthritis.

> (b)     Right wrist – intra-articular fracture with bone loss and comminution over volar-ulnar aspect of distal radius, with osteoarthritis.

> (c)     Right hip – segmental right femur shaft fracture with right intertrochanteric fracture.

4       In respect of pain and suffering for the injuries to the wrists, the deputy registrar awarded $15,000.00 for the left wrist and $10,000.00 for the right wrist. The plaintiff appeals this and submits the quantum should be $20,000.00 for each wrist. The deputy registrar awarded $86,570.10 for future medical expenses for the wrists and hip injuries. The plaintiff says on appeal that it should be $144,467.80.

5       The deputy registrar’s assessment of the damages was underpinned by his finding that the plaintiff has failed to discharge his duty to mitigate his loss by undergoing further surgery in or around November 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. The deputy registrar thus precluded the plaintiff from recovering damages attributable to the period after the projected time of recovery, if he had undergone further treatment. For the claim for future medical expenses, the deputy registrar awarded costs of treatment based on the costs estimated by the plaintiff’s medical expert in 2015. The deputy registrar was of the view that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate his damages by undergoing further surgery earlier. The deputy registrar’s reasons for his decision are set out in his judgment at _Padzul bin Mohamad v Lai Yew Chuang_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 145</span>.

6       The plaintiff disagrees that failure to mitigate damages is a factor in assessing the damages for pain and suffering, or future medical expenses. For the future medical expenses, he submits it should be based on the current estimated costs of the surgeries. Further, the plaintiff submits that the defendant is precluded from raising the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate damages when it is not pleaded in the defence.

## Issue to be determined

7       This appeal turns on the issue of mitigation of damages and its related questions. The issue to be determined by me can be taken in two related parts. They are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the defendant is precluded from raising the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate damages when it is not pleaded in the defence.

> (b)     Whether the plaintiff has failed to mitigate his damages.

## The medical evidence

8       The sequence of medical consultation, treatment and prognosis is relevant, and it is as follows.

9       The plaintiff first underwent surgery after the accident to re-align the fractured bones in each wrist and implant a metal plate to hold the bones together. For the left wrist, wires were inserted to hold the distal radius ulna (“DRU”) joints together, with further protection provided through a wrist splint.[^2] These procedures were carried out at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“KTPH”) where the plaintiff was first treated after the accident. The diagnosis of the fractures in his wrists and right hip at KTPH is set out in a medical report prepared by Dr Jeffery Tan Gek Meng (“Dr Tan”). Dr Tan was the plaintiff’s final treating doctor at KTPH. He was also one of the plaintiff’s expert witnesses at the assessment of damages. The plaintiff’s recovery from surgery was uneventful, and he was discharged from hospital on 30 April 2015.[^3]

10     Thereafter, the plaintiff consulted a private specialist, Dr Lim Beng Hai (“Dr Lim”) on 5 November 2015. Dr Lim gave expert evidence for the plaintiff in these proceedings. Dr Lim observed that although the wrist fractures had re-united, there were osteoarthritic degenerative changes in both DRU joints as revealed in a radiological scan. The osteoarthritis caused pain whenever the wrists were moved. Dr Lim advised that the plaintiff needed to undergo surgery to remove the wrist implants, address the osteoarthritis, and reconstruct the wrists. Dr Lim provided the estimated costs of the further surgery and the necessary follow-up therapy, which was in the sum of $78,570.10.[^4] The plaintiff however did not proceed for treatment.

11     On 21 November 2016, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Peter Lee Yew Cheng (“Dr Lee”). Dr Lee was the expert witness for the defendant at the assessment of damages. Dr Lee was of the view that the wrist fractures had re-united with good alignment but that the osteoarthritis would worsen over time. He stated that the wrist fractures had caused some loss of function in the forearm and wrists, which will remain permanent. He too advised further surgeries. He advised that the wrist implants required to be removed. He estimated the costs of the further surgery to do so to be $6,000.00. He estimated the costs of surgery to reconstruct the wrists to alleviate the pain and restore wrist movement to be $20,000.00 to $30,000.00 for each wrist. Dr Lee also advised that the hip implant should be removed. He estimated the costs involved to be $8,000.00.[^5]

12     The plaintiff attended at his final follow-up consultation at KTPH on 12 April 2017. Dr Tan noted that the plaintiff had stiffness and early osteoarthritic degeneration in both DRU joints. Dr Tan estimated the costs of the further surgery to remove the implants to be $6,000.00 to $8,000.00, and the costs of reconstruction to both wrists to be $16,000.00 to $20,000.00.[^6]

13     Finally, on 12 April 2018 Dr Lim reviewed the plaintiff and concluded that the osteoarthritis in the DRU joints had worsened and that there was malunion in the left distal radius bone. He advised the plaintiff to undergo the further surgery to correct the osteoarthritis, particularly in the left wrist. He warned that failure to do so would result in radial carpal osteoarthritis developing. By this time, his estimate of the costs of the further surgery was increased to $86,659.30 for the left wrist and $49,808.50 for the right wrist.[^7]

## The failure to plead the issue of mitigation

14     The first question that I will discuss in respect of the issue of mitigation of damages in this case relates to the matter of pleading. The plaintiff submits that the defendant is precluded from raising the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate damages when it is not pleaded in the defence, nor was notice in writing given of the defendant’s intention to rely on such failure. I note at the outset that there is little dispute that mitigation of damages is a matter that ought to have been pleaded by the defendant. The plaintiff referred me to the case of _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Fend Travel & anor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> (“_Tan Hun Boon_”). At \[100\], the High Court held:

> 100    Thus a defendant wishing to rely on the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate is required to plead the failure, giving sufficient particulars to alert the plaintiff of the nature of the defendant’s case and to avoid surprise. Where no pleadings are filed, the defendant is required to give notice in writing to the plaintiff long enough before the hearing to enable the plaintiff to meet the defendant’s claim of failure to mitigate.

15     As the issue of mitigation of damages was not pleaded in the defence, nor was any notice in writing of the issue given to the plaintiff, the question is whether the defendant is precluded from raising the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate damages. The deputy registrar takes the position that we cannot be descending blindly into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings. The deputy registrar referred to the recent decisions in _Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd and others v Mok Wing Chong (Tan Keng Lin and others, third parties)_ <span class="citation"></span><span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 645</span> and _BOM v BOK and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 349</span> (“_BOM_”).

16     I agree. In my view, we should not be unduly constrained by pleadings. Pleadings should not be viewed as straitjackets, shackling parties to absolute positions on formalistic and technical grounds. Doing so may hamper the fair disposal of disputes before the courts. In my view, the starting point in the analysis of any issues of pleadings must go back to the function of pleadings. We must bear in mind that one of the primary objectives of pleadings is for a party to inform the other parties of its case, so that no party is taken by surprise or denied the occasion to produce the evidence relevant to the dispute. It is clear to me that the test to be applied when such issues arise is to determine if the other party was taken by surprise by the lack of any pleadings. What is not allowed is litigation by ambush. Beyond that, the approach to pleadings should not be pedantic and circumscribed by rigid rules.

17     The defendant’s counsel referred to _BOM_ at the hearing before me and pointed out that the Court of Appeal’s approach to pleadings differed from that of the High Court in _Tan Hun Boon._ He urged me to adopt the approach in _BOM_. The passage on pleadings in _BOM_ at \[39\]-\[41\] is instructive, and I set it out in full here:

> 39    It is a trite principle that allegations of fraud must be pleaded with sufficient particularity. This principle finds statutory expression in O 18 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). It is a principle of natural justice that the court painstakingly upholds so as to ensure that the defendant knows the case it has to meet: see _Singapore Civil Procedure_ vol I (Foo Chee Hock JC, gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2018) at para 18/12/2. Accordingly, where a plaintiff succeeds on findings of fact that were not pleaded, the Court of Appeal will not allow the judgment to stand: see _Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 524</span> (“_Sheagar_”) at \[95\].

> 40    But one must also be careful _not_ to descend blindly into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings, and to always bear in mind that their ultimate purpose is to define the scope of the issues arising for the court’s determination and to ensure that the parties are not taken by surprise and deprived of the opportunity to adduce the relevant evidence: see, _eg_, _Sheagar_ at \[94\] and _Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd v Mok Wing Chong_ <span class="citation"></span><span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 645</span> at \[61\]. It is for this reason that we observed in _OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 231</span> that ‘evidence given at trial can, where appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is _not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced_’ … (at \[18\]).

> 41    We disagree with the Appellants that the Judge was not entitled to make a finding of fraud because we do not think it can be said that they were taken by surprise at the trial. The Appellants’ case is essentially that the Husband does not identify in his pleadings the type of misrepresentation (specifically, whether it is innocent or fraudulent misrepresentation) being alleged. However, while it is true that the Husband’s pleadings do not _literally_ contain the word “fraud”, it equally cannot be said that the Appellants were thereby prejudiced or were unaware of the case they had to meet.

> \[emphasis in original\]

18     Whilst the issue of pleadings in _BOM_ was peripheral to the decision in the case, the Court of Appeal’s view on the role of pleadings is significant. In my view, _BOM_ represents a softening of the long-held restrictive view of pleadings. The role of pleadings to define the scope of dispute and thus to inform parties of issues in contention is emphasised. The constrictive view of pleadings is rejected. The thrust of the approach in _BOM_ is that pleadings are to ensure that parties are made aware of the case to meet. The common refrain that parties are to be bound strictly by pleadings should now not be seen as an immutable tenet. In my view, the test of adequacy of pleadings that can be distilled from the case is whether the other party is taken by surprise, and thereby prejudiced. The context of the pleadings in _BOM_ is significant. The pleadings in question related to allegations of fraud. Litigation lawyers have long been told that allegations of fraud must be pleaded. Courts have held the same position. Not least of the reasons for holding so is that it is statutorily provided for in O 18 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). It is provided that allegations of fraud must be pleaded with sufficient particularity. Despite the given context however, the Court of Appeal did not feel constrained in applying the less restrictive approach to pleadings. It is striking the even when the pleading of specific matters is mandated by statute, the failure to plead them is not seen as an irrefutable bar to raising the matters at trial. It would appear that regardless of the nature of pleadings under consideration, the ultimate question to be answered in assessing the adequacy of pleadings is whether the other party knows the case it has to answer.

19     In the light of _BOM_, I am of the respectful view that the holding by the High Court in _Tan Hun Boon_ is of limited application. In any event, I note that even in _Tan Hun Boon_, the thrust of the decision is the need for the plaintiff to be alerted to the defendant’s case, and to avoid surprise. The key consideration is that the plaintiff must be aware that he has to meet the issue of mitigation of damages.

20     Returning to the present case, the question then becomes whether the plaintiff would have been taken by surprise by the defendant’s contention that there was a failure to mitigate damages. The answer would appear to be that it would not have been so. As seen above, the plaintiff’s own medical expert, who saw the plaintiff in 2015, had advised him then of the need to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. I note that the prospect of further surgery was also raised by the plaintiff’s other medical expert, Dr Tan in 2017. With both his medical experts advising on further surgery, in 2015 and then in 2017 respectively, I do not see how the plaintiff would not be aware of the need for further surgery.

21     It is telling that Dr Tan in his 2017 opinion noted that the plaintiff was not inclined to proceed with the surgery to remove the implants. Plainly, the plaintiff was not only aware of the need for further surgery, but had made an informed decision not to proceed with it. He had made this decision contrary to the recommendation of two of his own medical advisers. In the face of these facts, I do not see how the plaintiff is able to say that he was taken by surprise by any contention that he had failed to mitigate damages by seeking early treatment. He had in fact made a conscious choice since 2015 to delay pursuing further surgery.

22     It is pertinent to note that the defendant’s medical expert Dr Lee similarly referred to the need for the wrist implants to be removed. He estimated that the further surgery to do so would cost $6,000.00 and the surgery to reconstruct the wrists to alleviate the pain and restore wrist movement would cost $20,000.00 to $30,000.00 for each wrist (in November 2016). There is therefore evidence produced by both parties in respect of the need for early further surgery. The medical advice given to the plaintiff to undergo early further surgery is thus a matter that is very much central to the case, and that the plaintiff failed to follow the advice would have been an issue the parties are alive to. There is plainly no reason to bar the defendant from raising the issue of the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate damages.

## The principle of mitigation of damages

23     I turn to the second matter in respect of the issue of mitigation of damages. This is the question of whether the plaintiff has in fact failed to mitigate damages in deciding not to go for further surgery earlier. The general principle of mitigation of damages is uncontroversial. A claimant in an action in the tort of negligence must take all reasonable steps to mitigate his losses. If he neglects to do so, he will not be allowed to recover any loss that flows from his failure to so mitigate: _British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways Co of London Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1912\] AC 673</span> at 689.

24     A more refined analysis however, is necessary in applying the general principle to personal injuries cases, where the issues of medical treatment and medical advice have to be considered. It should also be noted at the outset that it is recognised that it is often easy on hindsight to criticise the steps which have been taken by a plaintiff in respect of treatment. The law addresses this concern by placing the burden of proving the failure to mitigate damages on the defendant.

### The test of reasonableness

25     Broadly speaking, where an injured plaintiff fails to follow the advice of his doctors to undergo medical treatment, the court will in considering whether he has acted reasonably to mitigate his losses look at all the circumstances of the case, including especially the medical advice that had been provided to him. If the doctors advise the plaintiff to undergo a reasonable course of treatment that would give him a reasonable chance of recovery, he ought to follow the advice. If he does not do so without reasonable grounds, he will not be allowed to recover damages in respect of a period extending after the projected time of recovery had that treatment been received. The High Court decision of _Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 54</span> (“_Ng Chee Wee_”) provides clear guidance on the issue of mitigation of damages in relation to medical advice rendered in personal injuries cases. Interestingly, neither party made reference to _Ng Chee Wee_ at the hearing before me. I therefore directed counsel to file further submissions on their views in regard to the application of the case.

26     I set out the relevant passage of _Ng Chee Wee_ at \[24\]:

> 24    Next, the defendant said that the plaintiff had unreasonably refused to accept the medical advice of doctors to amputate his leg below the knee which could have allowed him to resume work earlier. In considering whether a plaintiff acted reasonably in refusing an operation, the court must look at all the circumstances of the case, including particularly the medical advice which the Plaintiff received (_Selvanayagam v University of the West Indies_ \[1983\] 1 All ER 824 (PC), applied in _Ho Yiu v Lim Peng Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 28</span> (“_Ho Yiu_”)). If his own or other medical advisers advise a plaintiff to undergo a reasonable course of treatment which gives him a reasonable chance of recovery, the plaintiff ought to undergo that treatment to mitigate his loss; if the plaintiff refuses to do so without reasonable grounds, the defendant should not be made to compensate the plaintiff for damages in respect of a period extending after the projected time of recovery had that treatment been received (_Sivakami d/o Sivanantham v Attorney-General_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHCR 5</span> (“_Sivakami_”) applying _Marcroft v Scruttons_ \[1954\] 1 Lloyd’s Law Reports 395).

27     It would be seen that in determining the issue of mitigation of damages in a case where the injured plaintiff fails to follow the advice of his doctors to undergo medical treatment, the question would be whether it is reasonable for the plaintiff not to do so.

28     It should be noted that the High Court in _Ng Chee Wee_ at \[28\] and \[30\] also alluded to the requirement that the medical treatment in question must be one that is necessary for the plaintiff. In other words, the treatment advised by the doctors must be necessary, and not just a viable option of treatment. In my view, this requirement would in most cases be inherently satisfied. Doctors would not be expected to advise patients to undergo unnecessary medical treatment.

29     Both counsel in the present case agree in their further submissions that the test laid down in _Ng Chee Wee_ is whether an injured plaintiff has acted reasonably in failing to undergo the medical treatment advised by the doctors.[^8] It is not disputed that the burden is on the defendant to show that the plaintiff has acted unreasonably in forgoing or delaying medical treatment.

30     The plaintiff further submits that the court would look at each case on its own facts, to determine whether a plaintiff acted reasonably in failing to undergo treatment, based on the factual circumstances in his case.[^9] The plaintiff also submits that _Ng Chee Wee_ provided a method of inquiry used by the court in deciding how to compensate a plaintiff who has failed to mitigate his losses.[^10] I see no detraction in the plaintiff’s submission from the central principle laid down in _Ng Chee Wee_. It goes without saying that the court would look at each case on its own facts in determining the question of reasonableness.

### A framework for determining reasonableness

31     The question that falls to be determined by me therefore is whether the plaintiff was reasonable in not proceeding for further surgery when so advised earlier. In this regard, it should be noted that the test is one of _objective_ reasonableness. This can be seen in _Marcroft v. Scruttons_, \[1954\] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 395 (“_Marcroft_”), an English Court of Appeal decision referred to in _Ng Chee Wee_. Lord Justice Singleton held at 399:

> A man who is in an anxiety state may have difficulty in making up his mind, but on a question as to the treatment which he should have his mind is, or ought to be, made up for him by his own medical advisers. That is one of the purposes of having medical advisers. The patient would not know what he ought to do; the patient takes medical advice, and the patient ought to be guided by his medical advisers.

32     In other words, it is for a plaintiff to follow the medical advice given to him. It is not for him to measure up the medical advice given to him against his personal preferences or circumstances in deciding whether he should comply with it. Lord Justice Singleton concluded at 400:

> I do not wish to say anything that would hurt the feelings of a plaintiff in a case of this kind, but I believe it to be the duty of this Court to say that if a man is recommended by his own medical advisers and by others to undergo a course of treatment, he ought to undergo it; if he is advised that it gives him a reasonable chance of recovery, and if the treatment is reasonable, he ought to undergo it; if he will not, and does not, he must see that it is a little hard upon the defendants if they are to be asked to pay damages in respect of a period extending afterwards. If the general opinion is that treatment would cure him, or, at least, render him in a much better state in every way, then he ought to undergo the treatment.

33     In my view, the reasoning behind this admonishment must be right. One of the primary purposes of seeking medical advice is for a patient to determine the treatment he should undergo. The patient would not know what is best for him medically speaking. He ought to be guided by his medical advisers, which would be the reason for seeking medical advice in the first place. Provided that the medical opinion is that the treatment gives a reasonable chance of recovery and the treatment itself is reasonable, the patient ought to follow the medical advice given on the treatment to undergo.

34     Lord Justice Singleton’s approach, whilst seemingly harsh, provides us with useful guidance on how to determine whether an injured plaintiff has acted reasonably in failing to undergo treatment. What can be gleaned from the above passage in _Marcroft_ is that a plaintiff ought to undergo a course of treatment if the medical opinion is that the treatment gives a reasonable chance of recovery _and_ the treatment itself is reasonable. These would be the two conjunctive requirements in respect of the medical advice given. Provided they are met, the medical advice on a course of treatment ought to be followed. For completeness, I note that the requirement of necessity alluded to by the High Court in _Ng Chee Wee_ (\[26\] _supra_) at \[28\] and \[30\] (in that the medical treatment in question must be one that is necessary for the plaintiff) can be subsumed under the twin requirements in _Marcroft_. A course of treatment that gives a reasonable chance of recovery, and is itself reasonable must also be necessary for the plaintiff.

35     In my view therefore, in determining whether the plaintiff in a personal injuries case has acted reasonably in failing to undergo the medical treatment advised by doctors, the test would be one of objective reasonableness, which is to be applied by answering two questions:

> (a)     does the treatment give a reasonable chance of recovery; and

> (b)     is the treatment itself reasonable.

36     In the event that the answers to both questions are in the affirmative, a finding that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate damages should ordinarily follow. The above framework for determining reasonableness serves as a benchmark against which the subjective reasons that a plaintiff might proffer for not undergoing the treatment as medically advised can be measured. In my view, such a framework is useful, even necessary, given that a plaintiff who fails to follow medical advice for treatment would invariably point to personal circumstances that lead to the decision not to undergo the treatment advised. An objective standard is needed to determine the reasonableness in law of the decision to delay pursuing treatment.

### Reasonableness of the plaintiff’s action

37     I turn now to the question in the present case as to whether it was objectively reasonable for the plaintiff not to have proceeded for further surgery earlier, as advised by the doctors. The starting point of the analysis of this question goes back to the evidence of the medical experts for the plaintiff. Dr Lim had advised the plaintiff as early as 2015 of the need to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. In this regard, it should be noted that his advice was that the plaintiff would _need_ the further surgery. The plaintiff’s other medical expert, Dr Tan advised him likewise in 2017. Dr Tan advised that the surgery was needed to alleviate the pain and restore wrists movement.[^11] With both his medical experts advising on further surgery, the plaintiff had been placed in a position in 2015 and again in 2017, to decide in an informed manner whether to continue to bear the pain and disability from which he suffered or to seek relief through further surgery. Further, the defendant has produced evidence of his medical expert witness, Dr Lee who had in 2016 given the same advice to the plaintiff of the requirement for further surgery to relieve the pain and to restore wrist movement. The medical opinion of the plaintiff’s doctors and that of the defendant’s expert was that the surgery was needed for recovery. It should also be noted that there can be no question that the advice from all three doctors in respect of further surgery was that it was _necessary_, as opposed to an option of treatment.

38     As seen, the general medical opinion given to the plaintiff was that the further surgery would lead to a reasonable chance of recovery. There is no suggestion that the treatment itself is in anyway not reasonable. There is thus no basis for the plaintiff not to follow the medical advice given on the treatment to undergo. Further, it is noted that the medical opinion was clear that further surgery was necessary. Plainly, the plaintiff ought to have undergone the further surgery to aid his recovery and to relieve the pain. There is cogent evidence before me that the medical treatment provided the plaintiff a reasonable chance of recovery and the treatment itself was reasonable. The two questions having been answered in the affirmative, the plaintiff’s preference not to have early further surgery would be deemed unreasonable.

39     I turn now to the address the key case authority relied upon by the plaintiff in support of his contention that it was reasonable not to have proceeded for further surgery when advised by his doctors. This is the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in _Geest plc v Lansiquot_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 WLR 3111</span> (“_Geest_”). In this regard, I note firstly that the facts of _Geest_ are different from that of the present case_._ Like our case, _Geest_ concerns an assessment of damages hearing. However, a closer examination of the case would reveal that there was no evidence adduced there to suggest that the plaintiff had been placed in a position to decide in a rational way whether to seek relief through surgery. Unlike our case, in _Geest_, none of the doctors gave evidence. The only witness at the hearing was the plaintiff, who tendered her medical reports. In view of the limited evidence, the Judicial Committee held that the defendant had failed to discharge its burden to prove that the plaintiff’s refusal to go for surgery was unreasonable (see \[15\]). In this regard, I note that the court in _Tan Hun Boon_ had relied on _Geest_ in holding that the failure to mitigate damages should either be pleaded, or if not, the plaintiff is to be notified in writing by the defendant before the hearing. In my view, the facts of _Geest_ are peculiar in the manner in which the assessment of damages hearing proceeded. Not only were there very limited evidence offered, the assessment proceeded without any pleadings filed. The assessment of damages was said to have proceeded in an informal manner (see \[16\]). In my view, it is not a case of general precedent value.

40     In contract to _Geest_, in the present case, three medical expert witnesses – two for the plaintiff and one for the defendant – tendered their reports, gave evidence at the hearing and were cross-examined. The evidence shows that the plaintiff did not proceed for surgery to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists despite the advice of his own medical experts, who so advised as early as 2015. The defendant’s medical expert, Dr Lee had in 2016 likewise given the same advice to the plaintiff on the need for further surgery to relieve the pain and to restore wrist movement.

### The shifting of the evidential burden of proof

41     There is thus clear evidence adduced that the treatment advised by the doctors provided the plaintiff a reasonable chance of recovery and that the treatment itself was reasonable. I find that the plaintiff had acted unreasonably in deciding not to go for early further surgery despite the advice of his doctors.

42     As the defendant has adduced evidence to show that the decision not to proceed for early surgery was unreasonable, the evidential burden to prove that the decision was in fact reasonable shifts to the plaintiff: _Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 855</span> (“_Britestone_”). In _Britestone_, the Court of Appeal explained that the legal burden remains at all times with the party bearing it, but the evidential burden shifts to the other party upon the production of some (not inherently incredible) evidence by the first party of the relevant facts. In this case, the legal burden of proving the failure to mitigate damages remains with the defendant. However, having adduced evidence to show that the decision of the plaintiff not to go for early further surgery was unreasonable, the evidential burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that his decision was in fact reasonable.

43     In this regard, the plaintiff raised two reasons for not having gone for further surgery. The first is his preference for Dr Lim to perform the further surgery rather than Dr Tan. The second reason, which is related to the first, is that he did not have the funds for Dr Lim to perform the further surgery at the relevant time in November 2015. The plaintiff says that it was thus not unreasonable for him to decline to follow the advice to undergo surgery in or around November 2015 to remove the implants and reconstruct his wrists. He says that he wanted to undergo the procedure with Dr Lim as he specialises in hand reconstruction whilst Dr Tan specialises in general orthopaedics. In my view, the first reason proffered by the plaintiff is neither here nor there. It was in fact Dr Lim who first advised the plaintiff in November 2015 on the need for the further surgery. It is not the plaintiff’s case that Dr Lim was unable or unwilling to perform the surgery at that time. There is absolutely no evidence in this regard. By itself, the first reason does not answer the plaintiff’s failure to proceed with further surgery.

44     That leaves the second reason which is that he did not have the funds for Dr Lim to perform the further surgery at the relevant time in November 2015. In this regard, I note that the plaintiff has not produced evidence of his financial position at the material time in November 2015. When the plaintiff filed his first affidavit of evidence-in-chief in July 2017, he made no mention of any inability to afford such surgery.[^12] In fact, we have no more than the plaintiff’s bare assertion that the reason for the delay in pursuing treatment is his lack of funds.

45     The deputy registrar pointed out that there is no evidence that the plaintiff would not have been able to undergo the surgery unless he paid for it upfront. I agree that this is relevant in considering the plaintiff’s proffered reason of lack of funds for not undergoing the surgery. The plaintiff did not attempt to produce any evidence that he was refused treatment because he was not able to pay for it. The plaintiff has made a positive assertion that he did not pursue treatment because he lacked funds. It is for him to prove it. As alluded to above, the evidential burden of proving the reasonableness of not undergoing surgery has shifted to the plaintiff. It is for him to prove his contention that he did not undergo the surgery for lack of funds. In this regard, I find no evidence that would support the plaintiff’s contention. No details of any nature were offered to show that he had wanted to proceed with the surgery but was prevented to do so for lack of funds.

46     In the result, I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s bare assertion that he did not undergo the further surgery advised by Dr Lim in 2015 because he lacked the funds to do so. In fact, I find that the plaintiff has not provided a clear and cogent explanation for his decision not to undergo the further surgery as advised. He has not shown that his decision process is supported by evidence. The plaintiff has failed to show that he had acted reasonably in deciding to delay pursuing treatment.

47     There is thus clear evidence of the failure of the plaintiff to mitigate damages. I find that the plaintiff had acted unreasonably in deciding not to undergo further surgery despite the advice of his doctors. The burden of proving the failure to mitigate damages has been discharged by the defendant. That the evidence of the failure to mitigate damages included the evidence of the plaintiff’s experts does not mean that the defendant has not discharged his burden of proving the failure to mitigate, as suggested by the plaintiff. The nature of the evidence of failure to mitigate should not be conflated with the burden of proof. There is no bar to the defendant relying on the evidence of the plaintiff to show that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate damages. And in so doing, it does not follow that the defendant did not discharge his burden of proof. In fact, that the evidence of the plaintiff supports the defendant’s case that there was failure to mitigate damages only adds credence to the defendant’s case. I therefore hold that the burden of proving the failure to mitigate damages has been discharged by the defendant.

## Conclusion

48     The determination of the quantum under appeal follows from my finding on the issue of mitigation of damages. The delay in treatment worsened the pain and suffering from the wrist injuries and exacerbated the extent of future medical treatment required to treat those wrist injuries.[^13] The failure of the plaintiff to take steps to mitigate damages therefore speaks to both the question of pain and suffering, and the costs of future medical expenses. In respect of the costs of future medical expenses, the plaintiff will therefore be precluded from recovering damages in respect of the period extending after the projected time of recovery had the treatment been received, following _Ng Chee Wee_ at \[24\]. In respect of pain and suffering, the evidence of Dr Lim is that the osteoarthritis in the wrists have worsened since 2015. His evidence is that had the plaintiff undergone surgery in November 2015, the condition of the plaintiff’s wrists would not have deteriorated to the present extent.

49     In this regard, in respect of pain and suffering for the injuries to the wrists, the deputy registrar awarded $15,000.00 for the left wrist and $10,000.00 for the right wrist. He has based these figures on what would have been the likely condition of the plaintiff had he not delayed treatment but undergone the surgery as advised in 2015. As for future medical expenses for the wrists and hip injuries, he awarded $86,570.10 based on the costs of medical treatment at the time when the plaintiff was first advised to undergo the treatment. In my view, the deputy registrar’s approach is entirely in accordance with the evidence and the legal principles discussed above. I find no reason to depart from it.

50     For all of the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs, the quantum of which I will fix. Parties are to write to court within seven days with their submissions on the quantum of costs.
