### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to one count theft in dwelling punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code 1871 (“PC”) and s 50T of the Prisons Act 1933, and one count of failing to report for urine test under Regulation 15(3)(f) read with Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“the Regulations”).

2       He consented to have two counts of failing to report for urine test and one count of theft under s 379 PC taken into consideration.

## The charges

3       In relation to the s 380 PC charge, the Accused had stolen one bottle of ‘King Robert’ Blended Scotch Whiskey at the 7-Eleven store at Block 25 Upper Changi Road #01-626 (“the store”).

4       In relation to the failing to report for urine test charge, the Accused had failed to present himself for urine test on 6 January 2022 at the Bedok Police Division (“G Division”).

## The facts

### The theft in dwelling charge (DAC-900495-2022)

5       The Accused was 57 years old. On 1 January 2022, at about 12.30 am, the Accused tried to buy one 350 millilitres bottle of ‘King Robert’ Blended Scotch Whiskey valued at $32.00 from the store but was told that he was not allowed to do so as it was past 10.30 pm. He then decided to take the bottle of whiskey without paying for it. He left the store with the bottle of whiskey. A police report was lodged on the same day. On 10 January 2022, the Accused was arrested by the police at about 9.40 pm at the Giant Hypermarket located at the void deck of Block 534, Bedok North Street 3. He admitted to the theft and disclosed that he had disposed of the empty whisky bottle. No restitution was made.

### The failing to report for urine test charge (DAC-902312-2022)

6       The Accused was placed on a supervision order for 60 months (18 December 2021 to 17 December 2026) by virtue to Regulation 15(2) of the Regulations. Pursuant to a notice under regulation 15(3)(f) of the regulations dated 7 December 2021, the Accused was required to present himself for urine tests at G Division every Mondays and Thursdays of each month between 9.30 am to 10.00 pm during the period of supervisor, commencing from 20 December 2021. The Accused had failed to present himself for a urine test on 6 January 2022 (Thursday) without a valid reason. He was arrested on 10 January 2022. It was disclosed that he had failed to turn up for urine tests on a total of seven occasions.

### Breach of the conditional remission order

7       From 18 December 2021 to 29 April 2022, the Accused was subject to a remission order under Division 2 of Part 5B of the Prisons Act 1933 (‘the remission order”). The remission order was subject to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the Prisons Act 1933. The Accused had therefore committed the two offences in \[5\] and \[6\] while the remission order was in effect. Upon his conviction on these two offences, he was deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order. He was therefore liable to an enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act 1933 comprising imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order. In the case of DAC-900495-2022, the remaining duration was 119 days, and in the case of DAC-902312-2022, the remaining duration was 114 days.

## The sentence

### The prescribed punishment

9       The prescribed punishment for theft in dwelling was mandatory imprisonment of not more than seven years’ and shall also be liable to fine.

10     The prescribed punishment for failing to report for urine test was imprisonment of not more than four years or fine not exceeding $10,000 or both.

11     For the breach of the conditional remission order, the prescribed punishment was imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date the offence was committed. In this case, the aggregate length of all enhanced sentences should not exceed 119 days.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

12     The prosecution sought three to four months’ imprisonment for each of the two charges, with the sentences to run consecutively. As for the breach of the remission order, he sought for enhanced sentences of one-third to two-third of the remaining 119 days in relation to each charge. As to the actual number of days, the prosecution left it to the court.

### The mitigation plea

13     The Accused averred that he was sorry for the offences and pleaded for a lenient sentence. He also asked for a referral to the Institute of Mental Health so that he could undergo some emotional tests.

### The sentence by the court

14     In relation to the theft in dwelling charge, the Accused has a rather long record of previous convictions for s 379 and s 380 offences. His last conviction was for a s 379 offence in April 2020. He had stolen a duffel bag containing various army items, and a mobile phone valued at $700/-. He was sentenced to four months’ and two weeks imprisonment. Before that, in 2019, he was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for stealing items valued at $19.80. For these reasons, I found that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the present s 380 charge was appropriate.

15     In relation to the failing to report for urine test charge, I noted that he had no previous conviction for a similar offence. But he had a history of other drug related offences, namely drug consumption and possession. I also noted that for the present offence, he had absconded from urine tests on seven occasions. The sentencing range for this offence where the offender has pleaded guilty was between four to six months’ imprisonment. I found that four months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

16     The two proceeded charges comprised distinct offences and engaged different legally protected legal interests. As such, I ordered that the two sentences run consecutively. All said, the total aggregate sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was not disproportionate to the offences committed.

17     On the enhanced sentences under s 50T of the Prisons Act, I noted that the prosecution proposed a range between one-third to two-third of the remaining duration of the remission order for each charge. That translated to a range of 39 to 79 days. Given the severity of the offences, the short duration in which these two offences were committed, and the similarity of the fresh offences with those for which he was previously sentenced, I agreed with the prosecution that the case fell into the moderate degree of risk ie, Band 2 of the framework set out in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman & ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>. All considered, an enhanced sentence of 40 days each was appropriate and could not be said to be excessive or crushing.

## Conclusion

18     The total aggregate sentence imposed on the Accused was an enhanced sentence of 80 days’ imprisonment, and eight months’ imprisonment. The imprisonment sentence was backdated to the date of his first remand, 12 January 2022.

19     The Accused has lodged an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
