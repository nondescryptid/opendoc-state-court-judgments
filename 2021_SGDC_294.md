Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9268/2021/01.\]

30 December 2021

### District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong:

The accused, Mohamad Hanafian Bin Wajid, a 36-year-old male, pleaded guilty to 4 proceeded charges and consented to 11 other charges being taken into consideration for sentencing.

2       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly. I sentenced the accused to 7 years’ preventive detention. These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.

### Statement of Facts

3       The relevant extracts of the SOF are set out below:

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-913385-2021**

> 2.    Investigations revealed that in October 2020, the accused started working for an unlicensed moneylender known as Ah Seng.

> 3.    On 28 November 2020, between 7.00 pm and 7.19 pm, the accused assisted Ah Seng by going to Blk 156 Mei Ling Street, #XXX (“the unit”). The accused knocked on the main door of the unit. At the material time, Shahrul Bin Sahri (male, 23 years old) (“Shahrul”) resided at the unit with his mother and two brothers.

> 4.    Shahrul opened the main door and saw the accused standing outside. The accused showed Shahrul a photograph of Shahrul’s mother’s NRIC and asked for her. Shahrul told the accused that his mother was not at home. The accused said that she owed Ah Seng S$900 and that Ah Seng was looking for her. The accused asked for the handphone number of Shahrul’s mother. Shahrul called the police instead.

> 5.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused facilitated Ah Seng in carrying on the business of moneylending in Singapore when Ah Seng was not an excluded moneylender or an exempt moneylender or authorised to do so by licence. The accused has thereby assisted in the contravention of section 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”), which is an offence punishable under section 14(1)(b)(i) read with section 14(1A)(a) of the said Act.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-925890-2020**

> 6.    Investigations revealed that in early November 2020, the accused started working for an unknown unlicensed moneylender known as Calvin.

> 7.    On 24 November 2020, between 4.13 pm and 4.32 pm, the accused went to Blk 42 Chai Chee Street, #XXX (“the unit”). Pursuant to Calvin’s instructions, the accused wrote “Whatup 93614762” on a piece of paper (“the note”). The accused knocked on the main door of the unit, but no one answered. At the material time, Jhaveri Darpi Parshv Akumar (female, 40 years old) (“Jhaveri”) resided at the unit with her husband.

> 8.    The accused then went to the neighboring unit at #XXX and asked the neighbours if the occupants of the unit were at home. The neighbours said no, but the accused continued to loiter outside the unit. Thereafter, the neighbours called the police.

> 9.    During this time, the accused slipped the note underneath the main door of the unit, an act likely to cause annoyance to Jhaveri, in connection with a loan taken by an unknown debtor. Jhaveri noticed the note when she returned home later that night.

> 10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under section 28(2) (a) read with section 28(3)(a) of the MLA.

> 11.    Further, before the commission of the said offence, on 5 November 2014, the accused having been convicted in State Court No. 13 of an offence under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(b)(i) of the MLA, and sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside, and the accused is thereby liable for enhanced punishment under section 28(2)(b) read with section 28(3)(c) of the MLA.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-925440-2020**

> 12.    The victim is Nawarathnelage Dilhara Hansamali Nawarathene (female, 24 years old). The involved party is Malavarapu Praveen Kumar (male, 39 years old). The victim and the involved party are friends. At the material time, the involved party resided at Blk 503 Sembawang Road, #XXX, Seletaris Condominium, Singapore 757707 (“the flat”), which is a building used for human dwelling.

> 13.    On 3 December 2020, at around 10.28 pm, the involved party lodged a police report at Woodlands Division HQ stating that someone had stolen the victim’s handbag when she was visiting the involved party’s family at the flat.

> 14.    Investigations revealed that on 3 December 2020, at around 5.30 pm, the victim went to visit the involved party’s family at the flat. The victim brought her handbag which contained the following items:

>> a.    S$300 cash;

>> b.    One brown leather wallet;

>> c.    One DBS ATM card;

>> d.    One Sri Lanka identity card;

>> e.    One Ez-Link card;

>> f.    Three Sri Lanka ATM cards;

>> g.    One Singapore work permit bearing FIN XXX;

>> h.    One photograph of the victim’s boyfriend;

>> i.    One white iPhone X valued at S$380;

>> j.    One white iPhone 6s plus with a cracked screen valued at S$200; and

>> k.    One set of keys for the victim’s workplace.

> 15.    The victim placed her handbag on the shoe cabinet inside the flat, near the main door. Thereafter, she went to the living room of the flat with the involved party’s family. The main door was left open.

> 16.    At around 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm that day, the accused entered the Condominium. Calvin had instructed the accused to go to the Condominium and ask a debtor to pay him.

> 17.    The accused went to the wrong block and ended up outside the flat. The victim noticed the accused standing outside the flat and approached him. The accused asked for directions to another unit, but the victim told him that she was unsure. The victim went back into the flat to ask the involved party’s wife for help. Together, they tried to help the accused but could not find the unit that Calvin directed the accused to go to. Thereafter, they returned inside the flat without closing the main door.

> 18.    The accused saw the victim’s handbag near the main door on the shoe cabinet. After the victim and the involved party’s wife went inside the flat, he entered the flat and took the handbag containing the items stated above at \[14\]. The accused entered the flat with the intention of committing an offence of theft. Thereafter, he left the flat.

> 19.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of house-breaking in order to commit theft, which is an offence under section 451 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”).

> 20.    Further, before the commission of the said offence, on 7 July 2015, the accused having been convicted in State Court No. 10 of an offence of house-trespass in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment under section 451 PC, and sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside, and the accused is thereby liable for the enhanced punishment under section 458A PC.

> 21.    The victim’s wallet, Ez-Link card and iPhone X were recovered and returned to the victim. The accused admitted to selling the iPhone 6s plus for S$10.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO DAC-913383-2021**

> 22.    On 12 December 2020, between 8.20 pm and 8.30 pm, the accused went to Blk 438 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4, #XXX (“the unit”). Pursuant to Calvin’s instructions, the accused wrote “Better call me, $0, XXX1” on a piece of paper (“the note”). The accused knocked on the main door of the unit, but the occupants of the unit did not open the door. At the material time, Low Thiam Lai (male, 60 years old) (“Low”) resided at the unit with his wife and daughter.

> 23.    The accused left the note at the front metal gate of the unit, an act likely to cause annoyance to Low, in connection with a loan taken by Low.

> 24.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(a) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”).

> 25.    Further, before the commission of the said offence, on 5 November 2014, the accused having been convicted in State Court No. 13 of an offence under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(b)(i) of the MLA, and sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside, and the accused is thereby liable for enhanced punishment under section 28(2)(b) read with section 28(3)(c) of the MLA.

4       The 11 charges that the accused admitted to and consented to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing are:

> (a)     3 charges for assisting unlicenced moneylender in contravention of section 5(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”), which is an offence punishable under section 14(1)(b)(i) read with section 14(1A)(a) of the MLA.

> (b)     5 charges for harassing borrower with no property damage, under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(a) of the MLA.

> (c)     1 charge for theft of $2,200 cash at a minimart, under section 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> (d)     1 charge for disorderly behaviour, shouting at the staff of a restaurant and threatening to burn down the restaurant, under section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed)

> (e)     1 charge of failing to report change of place of residence within 28 days to a registration officer under section 13(1)(b) of the National Registration Act (Cap 201, 1992 Rev Ed).

## Antecedents

5       The accused was first convicted of theft in dwelling and cheating by personation offences when he was 18 years old and sentenced to Reformative Training Centre in 2003. He has been in and out of jail after that and has been convicted for offences including dishonestly receiving or retaining stolen property, voluntarily causing hurt, vandalism, carrying offensive weapon, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, disorderly behaviour, criminal breach of trust, drug consumption and theft by a clerk or servant of property in possession of master or employer. In 2014, he was sentenced to corrective training for unlicensed moneylending offences. In 2015, he was sentenced to corrective training for house trespass in order to commit an offence.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       The prosecution submitted that 7 years’ preventive detention was appropriate, given the accused’s antecedents, his anticipated future conduct, his lack of remorse, and the severity of the present offences. The accused was a menace to society who must be incapacitated for the protection of society.

7       First, the prosecution submitted that the technical requirements for imposing preventive detention as set out at section 304(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012)(“CPC”) were satisfied:

> (a)     The accused was 36 years old, above the prescribed age of 30.

> (b)     The accused was presently convicted of 4 offences, all of which were offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more.

> (c)     The accused had been convicted in Singapore at least 3 times since he reached the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least 2 of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training.

8       Second, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of preventive detention would be expedient for the protection of the public, applying the legal principle set out by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Rosli Bin Yassin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 831</span> (_“Rosli”_) at \[11\]. If the offender was such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of reform, thereby constituting a menace to the public, a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed in order to protect the public.

9       The prosecution also referred to the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Raffi Bin Jelan and another_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 120</span> (_“Raffi”_) at \[144\]. The Prosecutor submitted that the penological objective of preventive detention was preventive control that extended beyond the parameters of conventional sentencing which required the sentence to fit the crime. If the court formed the view that the offender, by virtue of his propensity to offend, may yet again do so if unchecked, there was a compelling case for the imposition of preventive detention. By reason of their past conduct and anticipated future conduct, such offenders have forfeited their right to be accorded the consideration and attributes peculiar to conventional sentencing and cannot complain if harsh measures were taken to isolate them.

11     The prosecution emphasised that the accused was a recalcitrant repeat offender who had strong criminal proclivities. Notwithstanding his numerous sentences involving significant periods of incarceration, the accused had remained unrehabilitated and undeterred. The accused had committed the present 15 offences barely 7 months after his release from corrective training. The preventive detention regime would be more appropriate especially having considered that the accused had been sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training for various offences, but he had not benefited from the time in corrective training.

12     The prosecution submitted that the accused’s pre-sentencing report findings concerning anticipated future conduct also supported a sentence of preventive detention:

> (a)     The accused was assessed to be in the high risk / needs level of criminal re-offending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release.

> (b)     The accused was assessed to have several contributing factors to his offending behaviour, including his poor emotion regulation, attitudes supportive of crime, alcohol and drug use, unconstructive use of leisure time, association with antisocial peers and not seeking support from his family.

> (c)     The accused minimised responsibility for his housebreaking and theft offences, and justified his unlicensed moneylending offences. He also downplayed the severity of his actions by claiming that he had not caused harm to the victims. His narrative presented with similar justifications for his past offending behaviours, as a means to obtain money quickly for his personal expenses.

13     Third, the prosecution submitted that when considering the suitability of preventive detention, the court would consider the issue of proportionality to a limited degree, applying the principle of _Sim Yeow Kee v PP and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> at \[97\]. The prosecution set out the following sentencing considerations for the proceeded charges.

> (a)     For the house-breaking charge to commit theft of handbag containing cash and phones and other items, the prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of 3 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate as the accused was previously sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training for an offence of house-trespass. The sentence would be in line with precedent case of _PP v Muhammad Ridhwan bin Abdul Rahim_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 38</span>, where the High Court upheld the sentence of 18 months imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane for a similar offence.

> (b)     For the repeat harassment offences committed under the MLA, the minimum mandatory sentence was 2 years’ imprisonment. The accused was previously sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training with 3 strokes of the cane per charge. While the present offences did not result in property damage, there was an escalation in the number of offences and the antecedents justified an uplift in the sentence so that a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate for each charge.

> (c)     The accused also faced a minimum mandatory fine of $30,000 and an imprisonment term for assisting unlicenced moneylender. The prosecution submitted that a sentence of $30,000 fine and 1 month’s imprisonment would be appropriate and in line with the precedent case of _PP v Lee Chien Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 100</span> where the offender’s appeal against the sentence of $30,000 fine and 1 month’s imprisonment lapsed.

> (d)     The prosecution submitted that court must order the sentences for at least 2 of the offences to run consecutively under section 307(1) of the CPC. The overall sentence would be 6 years’ imprisonment as the sentences for the housebreaking charge and MLA charge should run consecutively as they were unrelated offences.

14     In view of the above analysis, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of 7 years’ preventive detention would not be so disproportionate that the principle of proportionality was completely disregarded, given the 6 years’ global imprisonment sentence the accused would have faced in terms of a regular imprisonment term.

#### Mitigation

15     In his Mitigation Plea, counsel for the Defence submitted for a 6 years’ global imprisonment sentence as a regular imprisonment term. Counsel submitted that the accused came from a challenging background and had committed the offences due to financial hardship. Although the accused had re-offended, there was a de-escalation in his offences compared to the previous offences committed. The accused tried his best not to harm the victims by not damaging property. While the technical requirements for corrective training and preventive detention had been met, corrective training was not warranted because of the de-escalation in his offences. Sentencing the accused to preventive detention would not be appropriate as the accused’s offences were not serious and there was no violence committed by the accused. Counsel submitted that the entire preventive detention regime was about condemning someone, that society had tried everything and given up on the accused because he was dangerous and had no chance of reform.

16     Counsel submitted that the accused was not totally beyond reform. From being a totally anti-social person who had no regard of people around him, he now had regard for his victims, and he even tried to formulate his action to minimise the impact of events. Counsel also highlighted that the pre-sentencing report showed that there was a more than 25% chance that the accused would not reoffend.

### Court’s Decision

17     The main consideration for the court is whether a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. The general principles relating to preventive detention are set out in _Rosli_ at (\[10\]-\[11\]).

> 10.    Preventive detention ought to be imposed if the accused has shown that he is such a menace to society that he should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time (see PP v Perumal s/o Suppiah <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 145</span>). While the court will consider the need for the public to be protected from physical bodily harm, offences against property, such as theft, offences against the peace, such as affray, and offences against society in general, such as the consumption and possession of drugs, may also be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to be made. In Tan Ngin Hai v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 152</span> at \[8\], Yong Pung How CJ explained:

>> … In my view, there is no rule of law which states that protection of the public necessarily refers to protecting them only from physical bodily harm … As such, the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited through the commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again. …

> 11    The overarching principle is the need to protect the public (indeed, this principle is to be found in the express language of s 12(2) of the CPC itself (see above at \[3\])). This does not mean that the situation of the individual offender is irrelevant. However, the applicable principles in this particular regard are formulated with the public interest as the central point of reference constantly in view. Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but is not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. As Yong Pung How CJ put it in the Singapore High Court decision of PP v Wong Wing Hung <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 304</span> (“Wong Wing Hung”) at \[10\], the “sentence \[of preventive detention\] is meant essentially for habitual offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation” \[emphasis added\]. The court will look at the totality of the offender’s previous convictions (see the Singapore High Court decision of Tan Ngin Hai v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 152</span> at \[7\]).

18     The accused was a habitual offender with no respect for the law and authority. The pre-sentencing report stated that the accused had been incarcerated nine times, and he had six instances of institutional misconducts during his previous incarcerations. After his last release from corrective training in November 2019, the accused was offence-free in the community for about seven months and had committed his current offences between June and December 2020. His account in the pre-sentencing report indicated that he stayed out in the community for the longest duration after his last release from corrective training.

19     I noted that the accused had committed serious offences and was liable for enhanced punishment. The accused had committed housebreaking and theft offences, taking cash and other valuable items totalling about $3000 from residential and commercial properties. The accused had carried out harassment offences affecting many victims. The accused had also threatened to burn down a restaurant.

20     Counsel submitted that the accused had a challenging background and committed the offences due to financial hardship. I noted that the pre-sentencing report stated that the accused felt cared for by his family, but he did not turn to them for support when needed. He had planned to get married in March 2020 and his family had provided him money and helped with his wedding arrangements, however, he did not go through with the marriage. The accused also reported that he had worked in various jobs such as a management trainee in a food and beverage outlet, waiter, cleaner, cook and packer. He had received financial aid after his last release, as well as a “Workfare Special Payment” cash pay-out in October 2020. It is trite law that save for very exceptional or extreme circumstances, financial hardship cannot be relied upon as a mitigating factor. See _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ \[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 406. There were no exceptional or extreme circumstances in this case.

21     Counsel said there was a de-escalation in the manner the accused had committed offences. I noted the pre-sentencing report stated that the accused gave similar justifications for his past offending behaviours. The report stated that the accused was aware of the consequences of his actions. He minimised the severity of his actions by stating that he had not caused harm to the victims, as he had “only written a note and spoke politely” when committing his unlicensed moneylending offences. It was a serious concern that despite the previous convictions and sentences, the time spent in remand prior to the pre-sentencing report being called for; the accused continued to sugar coat, to paint an unrealistic picture of his actions and consequences, to justify re-offending to obtain money quickly.

22     I disagreed with counsel’s submission that the accused was suitable for rehabilitation under the regular imprisonment regime. The accused was a recalcitrant offender and had re-offended within months of each release from prison. Prior imprisonment sentences, corrective training, and caning have had little rehabilitative effect on him. He should be kept out of society so that he has no chance to get into his criminal tendencies. Considering the accused’s previous and present convictions and the high probability of recidivism and contributing factors (noted above at \[12\]), I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that a preventive detention sentence was necessary. It was not disputed by counsel that the technical requirements for imposing preventive detention had been met. The pre-sentencing report stated that the accused was assessed to be physically and medically suitable for preventive detention.

23     I disagreed with counsel’s submission that a preventive detention sentence meant that the accused was condemned, and that society had given up on him. It was noted that the Criminal Procedure Code (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Regulations 2010 sets out the three stages of detention for preventive detention and possibility of release on licence.

24     Under section 304(2) of the CPC, the term of preventive detention is not to be less than 7 years and not to be more than 20 years. The prosecution submitted that a minimum 7 years’ preventive detention from the date of sentence was appropriate. It was not disputed by the parties that the accused should face a global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment if he were to be sentenced to a regular imprisonment term.

25     I viewed that the accused’s criminal behaviour and the offences before the court were not so serious as to warrant a long preventive detention sentence. I also weighed the principle of proportionality, the time the accused had spent in remand since December 2020, the accused’s attitudes supportive of crime, association with antisocial peers and his reluctance to turn to his family for support. All things considered, I agreed with the prosecution that it would be in the public interest to impose a minimum 7 years’ preventive detention with effect from the date of the sentence. This would be a fair sentence taking into account the imperative to protect the public.

26     The accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.
