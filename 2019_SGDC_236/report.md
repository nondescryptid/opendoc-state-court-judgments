Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – s64(1) Road Traffic Act – Disqualification Order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9236/2019/01.\]

11 November 2019

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, a 22-year-old Singaporean male, was charged with dangerous driving under section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) \[“RTA”\].

2       On 7 December 2017 at about 2.10am, in order to avoid a police roadblock, the accused drove the motorcar no. SKF6564M (“the motorcar”) in such a manner which was dangerous to the public by reversing for about 203 metres on the left lane of a two-lane road along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central at or near to lamppost 86A before turning into Jalan Jurong Kechil.

3       On 16 September 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the singular charge and he was thereafter sentenced accordingly as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.94%"> <col width="67.06%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence Ordered</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TP-176237159111</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 64(1) RTA</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine of $4,500, in default eighteen (18) days' imprisonment. Disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of ten (10) months with effect from 16 September 2019.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       The accused paid the fine amount in full. Instead, he is appealing because he was only dissatisfied with the 10-month order of disqualification from driving for all classes of vehicles imposed on him in relation to the dangerous driving charge.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

### The Charge

5       The charge reads as follows:

> You, are charged that you, on 7 December 2017, at about 2.10m, along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central along lamp post 86A, Singapore, did drive motor car with licence plate SKF 6564M in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, _to wit_, by reversing for about 203m on the left lane of the two lane road along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central along lamp post 86A before turning into Jalan Jurong Kechil towards Pan Island Expressway, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).

### Statement of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 19 July 2018 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence of dangerous driving reads as follows:

> …

> 2.    On 7 December 2017 at about 2am, police officers from Bukit Batok NPC was performing roadblocks at Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central along lamppost 86A.

> 3.    At about 2.10am, several officers saw the Vehicle travelling on the left lane of the two-lane road along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central along lamppost 86A. The Vehicle then stopped about 176m from the roadblock, before it started reversing for about 203m before turning into Jalan Jurong Kechil towards Pan Island Expressway.

> 4.    The sketch plan is at Tab A.

> 5.    Photos of the scene is at Tab B.

> 6.    The CCTV from Park Nature Condominium located at 33 Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 managed to capture parts of the incident.

> 7.    The accused admitted to reserving the Vehicle. He stated that as he was driving, he was thinking that there would usually be roadblocks in that area. He then noticed a taxi that was travelling in front of him braked and he was sure that there was a roadblock ahead even though he did not see it. Hence, he braked and started reserving the Vehicle before making a left turn into a side road. He also stated that he had reversed to avoid the roadblock because he did not have his NRIC or driving licence with him, and he did not want to have to answer questions.

> 8.    By virtue of the above, the accused has committed one count under s64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) by driving in a manner which was dangerous to the public, _to wit_, by reversing for about 203m of the left lane of the two lane road along Bukit Batok East Avenue 6 towards Bukit Batok Central along lamp post 86A before turning into Jalan Jurong Kechil towards Pan Island Expressway.

10     The accused confirmed the antecedents to be correct.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

11     The Prosecution orally submitted for the maximum fine of $5,000 and an appropriate period of disqualification to be imposed against the accused for the said s64(1) charge. The Prosecution felt that the maximum fine was warranted in this case to serve as a deterrence because:

> (a)     The accused had driven dangerously by driving and reversing his motorcar against the flow of traffic in order to evade a police roadblock;

> (b)     The accused had intentionally reversed his motorcar for a rather extended distance of about 203 metres along the road to the next junction in order to change his direction of travel;

> (c)     Although no actual harm or accident was caused by the accused’s actions, the potential harm to other road users can be great;

> (d)     The accused’s actions were clearly intended to obstruct or disrupt police operations; and

> (e)     The relatively poor driving record of the accused. The history in respect of the accused’s traffic offences included both court convictions and compounded offences.

### Mitigation

12     The defence tendered a written mitigation plea.

13     On the personal front, the accused is employed as a car salesman. He is married to a homemaker with a young child. He is also supporting his parents.

14     The accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage, suggesting his genuine remorse.

15     The defence sought for a sentence with only a fine to be imposed. However, should the court be minded to impose a disqualification order, it submitted that a period of one to two months would suffice in the present case. This was because:

> (a)     No accident was caused and there was no harm caused to any persons or property;

> (b)     There were no other aggravating factors. For example, the accused was not speeding at the material time of the offence;

> (c)     The accused had committed the offence on the spur of the moment by reversing his motorcar. He did not evade the police roadblock in order to avoid being arrested. He had merely wanted to avoid the hassle of explaining to the police why he did not have his wallet or identification documents with him;

> (d)     When he reversed his car, the traffic was clear and he did not obstruct any vehicles Moreover, he felt he was still not within the view of any police or police vehicle; and

> (e)     As he is a car salesman, his livelihood depends on his driving licence for the wellbeing of his family.

16     Additionally, Defence counsel argued that whilst this was not a usual or typical situation of dangerous driving, he felt that the maximum fine sought for by the Prosecution was rather stiff.

### Reasons for Sentence

17     Section 64(1) of the RTA states:

> Reckless or dangerous driving

> 64.—(1)    If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.

18     For the disqualification period, pursuant to s42(1) of the RTA:

> Disqualification for offence

> 42.— (1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

19     Here, the key issue was whether the 10-month period of disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes (“DQAC”) of driving licences imposed was the appropriate sentence in view of the accused’s actions in the present case since the accused is only disputing the disqualification order and not the fine amount imposed.

20     It is pertinent to note that the accused has accepted the fine of $4,500 imposed, which is close to the maximum fine of $5,000 sought for by the Prosecution.

21     Both the Prosecution and the accused did not provide any authorities for this matter.

22     At the outset, it would be useful to highlight the seminal High Court decision of _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 123 (“_Koh Thiam Huat”)_, which was a case which similarly involved a dangerous driving offence. In _Koh Thiam Huat_, the High Court has set out the two principal parameters to which a sentencing court should have regard in evaluating the seriousness of a crime, which is applicable to a traffic offence, and they are:

> a.     harm caused by the offence; and

> b.     the accused’s culpability.

23     See Kee Oon J held at \[41\] that “harm” is a measure of the injury which has been caused to society by the commission of the offence and “culpability” is a measure of the degree of blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.

24     In the context of the offence of dangerous driving, See J further held at \[41\]:

> …the primary factor relating to the harm caused would be the extent of injury or damage caused. _A related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike_. The factors increasing the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving. As illustrations, the aggravating factors identified in Hue An Li, i.e., speeding, drink-driving and sleepy driving, would clearly contribute to this, as would driving while using a mobile phone. In addition, _if the dangerous driving was deliberate (for instance, in “hell riding” cases), this would also indicate a higher level of culpability_. Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence per se. These include (but are not limited to) an accused’s good or bad driving record, as well as his remorse or lack thereof. \[emphasis added\]

25     As such, in terms of “harm”, the potential harm that might have been caused to other road users or pedestrians is an important factor for the courts’ consideration when it comes to dangerous driving behaviour.

26     In terms of “culpability”, factors which would increase the accused’s culpability would include a particularly dangerous manner of driving, aggravating factors (like speeding, drink driving and sleepy driving) and the deliberate manner of driving dangerously.

27     Aside from these two principal parameters, the court should also have regard to other mitigating and aggravating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence _per se_. They could include the accused’s driving record as well as his remorse or lack thereof.

#### The Appropriate Sentence Imposed

28     In relation to the harm caused, whilst no actual harm had resulted in this case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the potential harm that can be caused to other road users and pedestrians could be great or serious. The accused deliberately drove against the flow of traffic by reversing his car for an extended distance of 203 metres along a main road. This was indeed a very dangerous manner of driving even if it was about 2.10am in the early morning of 7 December 2017 where traffic flow was not expected to be heavy.

29     Regardless, as it was in the night, other road users might not have been able to anticipate that a vehicle would be travelling against the flow of traffic along the main road by reversing in a manner such that they would be able to take evasive action in time. Moreover, there were no parallel parking lots along the entire stretch of that road.

30     Next, whilst there was no evidence of him speeding, he was nonetheless reversing at a considerable speed in order to evade a police roadblock ahead of him. The position of his motorcar was away from the road kerb. He certainly was not reversing at a slow speed as if he was parking or attempting to park his car. His actions were clearly intended to obstruct or disrupt police operations. This was, in my opinion, an aggravating factor. Thankfully, besides being captured by the CCTV camera of the nearby condominium, the police in this situation were vigilant and caught him in the act. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that such a calculated and deliberate act cannot and should not be condoned.

31     Following from there, I was of the view that the culpability of the accused in this present case could not be said to be low but at the very least medium. A general and specific deterrent sentence is also necessary given the circumstances in which the offence was committed.

32     Generally, as a starting point, the period of disqualification would commensurate with the fine amount imposed on an accused to reflect the culpability of the offender as well as the harm caused or the potential harm that can be caused. This means that an accused who is imposed with a lower fine amount will generally be given a shorter disqualification period than an accused who is imposed with a higher fine amount.

33     Since the maximum fine that can be imposed on a first offender under s64(1) of the RTA was increased from $3,000 to $5,000 on 20 June 2017, there has also been a corollary increase in the disqualification period being imposed on offenders who committed the offence on or after that date.

34     A search conducted in the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (“SIR”) on cases with the offence of dangerous driving decided between 20 June 2017 and 30 September 2019 where fines were imposed revealed that the median disqualification ordered was 1 year. The mean period of disqualification ordered was about 10.8 months (i.e. approximately 10 – 11 months). A diagram of the search outcome is as follows:

![]([2019] SGDC 0236_Image/[2019] SGDC 0236_image8.png)

35     A search conducted on both reported and unreported decisions after 20 June 2017 for cases where a fine of between $4000 to $5000 had been imposed on the accused for the offence of dangerous driving revealed the following disqualification orders which have be ordered against them:

36     As can be seen from the cases, in majority of the cases (i.e. 11 out of 16 cases or about 69%) where a fine of $4,000 was imposed, the accused were given a disqualification order of 12 months. This effectively meant that the accused would have to take their driving licences again after the end of the disqualification period.

37     In cases where the accused was imposed a fine of at least $4,500, none of the accused received a disqualification order of less than 11 months. In fact, other than one, the rest received a disqualification order of at least 12 months or more.

38     Given the circumstances, the Defence’s submission of 1 to 2 months’ DQAC would clearly be woefully inadequate.

39     Moreover, I had taken into account the accused’s plea of guilt as a sign of remorse. On the other hand, I had to give thought to the accused’s driving record. He not only had compounded traffic offences for speeding, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident within 24 hours, inconsiderate driving and causing a vehicle to remain at rest in a position likely to cause danger to other road users, but court convictions for driving whilst underage and without insurance coverage.

40     All things considered, I was of the view a disqualification order of 10 months was justified and could not be said to be manifestly excessive since this was effectively at the lower end of the sentencing range based on the fine amount imposed.

41     In fact, I would emphasize that I had been rather lenient with the accused by taking into consideration of the fact that no accident was caused. Besides, I was acutely aware that the accused requires his driving licence for his livelihood. Otherwise, I would have imposed at least the usual sentence of 12 months DQAC based on the fine amount imposed. Yet, a sufficiently adequate period of disqualification is necessary to have a deterrent effect in order to deter or discourage like-minded offenders from committing the same offence by driving in a dangerous manner to evade police roadblocks. As a matter of policy reasons, such offenders should not expect a slap on the wrist.

## CONCLUSION

42     To summarise, as aforementioned, the accused was sentenced accordingly:

43     On 30September 2019, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal against the order of the period of disqualification from driving for 10 months imposed on him. On 7 October 2019, I granted a stay of the disqualification order pending his present appeal.
