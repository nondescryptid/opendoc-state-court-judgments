4       I sentenced the Accused to undergo Reformative Training for a minimum of 12 months detention in a Reformative Training Centre with effect from the date of sentence.

5       The Accused has now appealed against his sentence. I will now give my grounds of decision.

## ANTECEDENTS

8       The Accused is untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS

9       The Prosecution submitted that a Reformative Training Suitability Report ought to be called for in this case.

10     The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused reoffended many times while on bail. In fact, the Accused absconded from the previous Plead Guilty mention.

11     The Prosecution supported its assertion that the bulk of the Accused’s charges (12 out of 14 charges) arose from offences committed while he was out on bail, with the following details:

> (a)     DAC-929220-2018: On 19 July 2018, while on station bail

> (b)     DAC-933727-2018: On 19 July 2018, while on station bail

> (c)     DAC-933728-2018: On 26 August 2018, while on station bail

> (d)     DAC-919585-2019: On 29 March 2019, while on court bail

> (e)     DAC-919586-2019: On 29 March 2019, while on court bail

> (f)     DAC-919587-2019: On 29 March 2019, while on court bail

> (g)     DAC-919588-2019: On 19 April 2019, while on court bail

> (h)     DAC-919589-2019: On 19 April 2019, while on court bail

> (i)     DAC-919590-2019: On 19 April 2019, while on court bail

> (j)     DAC-930622-2019: On 19 April 2019, while on court bail

> (k)     DAC-930623-2019: On 17 September 2019, while on court bail

> (l)     DAC-930624-2019: On 17 September 2019, while on court bail

12     The Accused did not contest these submissions.

13     Indeed, this was borne out by the Accused’s case history (in particular, his bail history) in the court records.

14     In any event, the Statement of Facts, at paragraphs 15 and 22, had made particular mention that DAC-919590-2019 and DAC-930623-2019 were committed while the Accused was released on court bail, and he had unequivocally admitted to the same.

## MITIGATION

15     The Accused pleaded to be placed on Probation, and indicated that he was awaiting his National Service enlistment.

16     The Accused indicated to the Court that he had realised his mistakes and he wanted to continue his education and do his National Service. He highlighted that he had been in remand and his mother is a single parent.

17     In response, the Prosecution submitted that given the pattern of offending, specific deterrence was necessary and the appropriate sentence would be Reformative Training and not Probation. Further, the severity of the offences could not be underscored, with two of the charges carrying a minimum sentence of one year’s imprisonment.

18     The Prosecution also cautioned of the risk of the Accused breaching his Probation conditions, given that he had previously breached his bail conditions.

## PROBATION VERSUS REFORMATIVE TRAINING

19     The Accused was about a month shy of his 19th birthday at the time of the conviction.

20     For young offenders, while rehabilitation would remain a dominant sentencing consideration, considerations of deterrence were present in the Accused’s case, given several aggravating factors.

21     Even if the Accused had rehabilitative potential, the need for general deterrence and specific deterrence were also important given the nature and gravity of the offences and the pattern of offending.

22     The offences that were committed by the Accused were predominantly drugs offences, by no measure petty crimes nor crimes committed once off in the heat of the moment or in a moment of folly.

23     Singapore has always maintained its strict and uncompromising position against drugs offences. In **_Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 63</span>, VK Rajah J observed the following at paragraph 59:

> _“The consumption of drugs is a grave menace and an anathema to the fabric and well-being of society, and must be uncompromisingly stamped out…”_

24     Generally, probation would be inappropriate for serious offences.

25     Indeed, the seriousness of the Accused’s offences was borne out by the fact that two of the Accused’s offences, DAC-919590-2019 and DAC-930623-2019, carry a minimum imprisonment term of one year.

26     The seriousness of the **_type_** of offences committed by the Accused has to be juxtaposed against his **_pattern_** of offending.

27     The Accused demonstrated that, once he was afforded a modicum of liberty while out on bail, he ran afoul of the law.

28     After committing the first series of offences, the Accused did not keep out of trouble. While on station bail, he committed further offences. Even after he was placed on court bail, he committed yet further offences. At the previous Plead Guilty mention, he absented himself, resulting in a Warrant to Arrest being issued and upon him being taken into custody and no bail was offered. The Accused offered no good reason for his absence during his mitigation. Absenting oneself from court without good reason, especially while on bail, was clearly not a sign of any remorse.

29     Having regard to all the circumstances, I was of the view that the primary sentencing consideration appropriate to the Accused was deterrence. I thus remanded the Accused for the preparation of a Reformative Training Suitability Report.

## THE REFORMATIVE TRAINING SUITABILITY REPORT

30     At the mention on 16 January 2020, the Reformative Training Suitability Report was placed before the court. The same was read and explained to the Accused.

31     The Prosecution reiterated the seriousness of the Accused’s offences and the alarming rate at which he offended. In particular, the Prosecution drew the court’s attention to the recommendations at page 7 of the Reformative Training Suitability Report. The Accused had been found to require Level 2 supervision, having been found to have multiple needs that require intervention.

32     It was clear to me from the Reformative Training Suitability Report that the Accused never acknowledged his wrongdoing and he did not take ownership and responsibility for his offences.

33     Firstly, at page 6 of the Reformative Training Suitability Report, the Accused was “assessed \[to have\] held a general disregard for the law”.

34     The Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist further noted that the Accused “verbalised that he was aware of the consequences of law violation but continued to offend because he was confident that he would not be caught” and “in response to his current charges, \[the Accused\] also mentioned that he had been unlucky to be arrested”.

35     I found that the Accused sought to “challenge the system” and displayed a “daredevil” attitude, holding onto a belief that his confidence and bravado would ensure that he would not be caught. This resulted in streaks of offences committed even while he was out on bail.

36     Further, the Reformative Training Suitability Report found that the Accused had disregarded his family’s advice on several occasions, for example, staying out late and associating with antisocial companions despite his family’s disapproval. He had also, on various instances, failed to return his mother’s calls.

## CONCLUSION

37     It was clear to me that the Accused would benefit from a comprehensive and structured regime that will instil a sense of responsibility and discipline in him, and hopefully, in the long run, reform him.

38     I informed the Accused that he had been found physically mentally fit and suitable to undergo Reformative Training.

39     In line with the recommendation in the Reformative Training Suitability Report, I sentenced the Accused to undergo Reformative Training for a minimum of 12 months detention in a Reformative Training Centre with effect from the date of sentence.

40     The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence, has filed this appeal. He is presently serving his sentence.
