### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is the sole proprietor of Phra Pirab Occult Specialist (“PPOS”) which is described as a business selling occult items as well as providing spiritual services, astrology, palmistry and fortune-telling services. The plaintiff describes himself as the in-house master of PPOS specialising in the provision of occult services and is known by his professional name, Aghoreshwar Babaji[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). According to the plaintiff, he is well-versed in Thai and Indonesian occult sciences, has more than 18 years of experience in the performance of occult rituals and enjoys a strong reputation in the occult world with more than 47,000 Facebook followers[^2].

2       The first defendant was engaged as a shopkeeper to run the plaintiff’s business located at Block 34 Whampoa West #01-33 Singapore 330034 (“the Business Premises”) from 1 July 2013 to 16 July 2018. The plaintiff terminated the first defendant’s engagement when it was discovered that he had allegedly failed to properly account for the sales proceeds of the shop and was suspected of misappropriating funds[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

3       On 25 and 27 April 2019, the first defendant published three posts on two different Facebook profile pages which carried the titles “Phra Pirab SCAM Specialist” and “Aghori BabaRai” concerning the plaintiff[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). While it is not disputed that the Facebook pages have been removed, the plaintiff nonetheless claims that he had been defamed by the first defendant’s publications of 25 and 27 April 2019[^5].

4       The plaintiff commenced the present action against the first defendant to claim the following:

> (a)     an injunction and damages in respect of the three Facebook posts made on 25 and 27 April 2019;

> (b)     the sum of $13,722 as money had and received by the first defendant to the use of the plaintiff. This was the aggregate sum of the proceeds of sale of various items allegedly received by the first defendant while he was the plaintiff’s shopkeeper which were unaccounted for; and

> (c)     the sum of $48,750 being arrears of rental in respect of the residential quarters at the Business Premises which the first defendant had occupied from October 2015 to 16 July 2018.

5       The plaintiff had also included in this action, his claim for defamatory Facebook posts made by the second defendant whom he alleges to be a friend of the first defendant. The first defendant, however, denies knowing the second defendant[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

6       The first defendant has denied all of the plaintiff’s claims against him. He had also initially made a counterclaim against the plaintiff for _inter alia_ unpaid salaries as well as defamation arising from a series of defamatory posts made against him by the plaintiff on various Facebook pages and on another platform called Carousell. The counterclaim was discontinued before trial. As the second defendant failed to enter an appearance to the action, the plaintiff’s action proceeded to trial against the first defendant only.

## The plaintiff’s case

### Defamation

7       The plaintiff claims that the post (“First Omar Post”) published by the first defendant on 27 April 2019 under the Phra Pirab SCAM Specialist profile (defined in his statement of claim as the “Scam Facebook Profile”) in their natural and ordinary meaning meant that[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7):

> (a)     the plaintiff is a conman who falsely holds himself out as a guru or master in order to defraud his customers and fund his lavish lifestyle;

> (b)     the plaintiff offers for sale rituals or other occult services which are fake or stolen from others, but passed off as his own, and is thereby guilty of fraud; and

> (c)     the plaintiff is an alcoholic who threatens to curse others with black magic in order to force them to buy him beer.

8       The entire post comprising text and images spanning eight pages was reproduced and annexed to the statement of claim[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). It stated _inter alia_ as follows:

> “Dear bros and sis. Pls help to SHARE this biggest amulet SCAM shop in Singapore. What I will say are not baseless and with real evidence. Please help to SHARE.

> Calling ALL Singapore Amulet Dealers, Collectors and people who got CHEATED by this very famous CONMAN “BABA” PHRA PIRAB OCCULT SPECIALIST (or Phrapirab THAPRACHAN specialist) shop to come together and share your distasteful experience as well as like and share about this big con shop in Singapore that has been cheating people so so many years.

> …

> This is the very same conman master that got slapped and beated up at pearl center toilet by a neighbouring shop because he was running his mouth. This story very famous everyone in the amulet market know.

> …

> FIRST, let me expose this FAKE Aghori conman claiming himself to be BABA. Then I will expose all his fake amulet scams one by one for all of you

> Aghoreshwar Babaji is NOT a real aghori master. He claim to be aghori and use scare tactics to that people will believe him and feel intimidated by him. He is no other than a delusional drunkard who got exposed for asking a customer at Pearls Center to buy him beer otherwise he will curse them with black magic. Those on amulet forums will know this story is true

> Here are all the common scams run by PPOS.

> WEALTH TAKRUT / ASURA TAKRUT / VASHIKARAN TAKRUT SCAM.

> This is their most famous scam of all. His so called signature “wealth fetching & Gambling takrut” that has so many fake testimonials was in fact not done by him but copied from a online occult website known as Prophet666.com. If you are a real master surely you will learn your own spells from your lineage or have you own book but you copied from GOOGLE? Well done!

> https://www.prophet666.com/2011/05/yantra-for-success-in-gambling.html

> That is the link to the website that he copied onto a white cloth to sell his takrut for $150. So basically everyone who bought it are merely paying for something that is free online. Real master?

> …

> FAKE PLAYBOY TAKRUT. This takrut originally known as yant maha khun paen was first created by AJ Ruang and AJ Lak that came to ppos 8 years ago. During that period they only made limited pc. All the “Playboy” takrut that BABAJI advertised today claiming to be from AJ Ruang are all man made by himself. He just inscribe a Maha Saneh yant on it and claim its yant maha khun paen from AJ Ruang. Selling at $128. Everyone in Amulet Forums know that the original Yant Maha Khun PAen was very hot selling.

> This FAKE Aghori Master also made customers pay $300 for a “Kali Kriya” Ritual to “Improve their wealth” where they have to do chanting for a period of days. This can be found for FREE On this website that he copies all his item http://www.prophet666.com/2011/06/most-powerful-wealth-mantra.html

> LOVE RITUAL SCAM - BABAJI Claim to help people with love spell and ritual. He charges 600-10k (yeah one china lady even paid 10k) for NOTHING. …

> This scam was also exposed on AMULET FORUMS. How this scam work is he tell the customer that he can do the ritual, collect money and tell the customer that he needed 1 week to perform the ritual but in fact he did not do anything at all.

> …

> …

> So basically this AGHORESHWAR BABAJI from PHRA PIRAB OCCULT SPECIALIST is nothing more then a FAKE master who even went to the extend of asking his cousin to pretend to be a corpse so that he can meditate on it asking his disciple to take picture to advertise as “Shava Sadhana”

> Aghoreshwar BABAJI is nothing but a drunkard who will drink with random customers after a few alcohol start to be emotional, cry and moan infront of everyone.

9       The second post complained of by the plaintiff (identified as the “Second Omar Post”) was published under the Aghori BabaRai Facebook profile (defined in his statement of claim as the “Aghori Facebook Profile”). It comprised a single page of images and text and contained the following words which are said to be defamatory of the plaintiff[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9):

> “NICE FAKE COPY FROM AGHORESHWAR BABAJI

> 9 PLANET YANTRA WITH WEALTH YANTRA COPIED FROM PROPHET 666.COM

> hmm.. don’t tell me in this world theres only 1 yantra for wealth. SELF PROCLAIM AGHORI BABA WITH SO MANY DISCIPLE TO SELL HIS FAKE SCAM SHIT”

10     The third post complained of by the plaintiff (identified as the “Third Omar Post”) was similarly published by the first defendant under the Aghori Facebook profile. It also comprised a single page of images and text. The words which the plaintiff says are defamatory of him read as follows[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10):

> “Dear bros and sis. Pls help to SHARE this biggest amulet SCAM shop in Singapore. What I will say are not baseless and with real evidence are posted. Please help to SHARE.

> Aghoreshwar BABAJI (Rakesh RAI) The BIGGEST CONMAN + THIEF in the amulet business. Owner and self proclaim master of PhraPirab Occult Specialist.

11     The plaintiff pleads that in their natural and ordinary meanings, the second and third Posts made by the first defendant meant, and were understood to mean, that the plaintiff is a conman and a thief who falsely holds himself out as a guru or spiritual leader and sells fake amulets in order to defraud his customers[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

12     By reason of the publications of the three Posts, the plaintiff alleges that he has been gravely injured in his character, his personal and professional reputation and has suffered considerable distress, embarrassment and hurt to his feelings. Accordingly, he claims both general and aggravated damages.

### Monies had and received

13     The second head of the plaintiff’s claim is for cash proceeds that the first defendant is alleged to have received from the plaintiff’s customers which he had failed, neglected or refused to account and hand over to the plaintiff. The first defendant’s actions are said to be in breach of the express or implied terms of his engagement as the plaintiff’s shopkeeper at the material time[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12).

14     The amounts claimed against the first defendant relate to specific items as described in the statement of claim and calculated by the plaintiff in the total sum of $13,722. The breakdown, particulars of the items[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) and the names of the customers[^14] who had bought the items in question are set out as follows:

15     The items listed above had allegedly been purchased from the shop by the 11 named customers of PPOS at various times[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) from March 2014 to July 2018. They had made payments to the first defendant who was allegedly seen placing the monies in his pocket or into a small box next to the cash register. No receipts were issued.

### Tenancy

16     The third head of the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant is for the sum of $48,750 being arrears of rent. The plaintiff says that the first defendant had signed a tenancy agreement dated 1 October 2015 by which he agreed to rent the residential quarters on the second floor of the Business Premises for the sum of $1,500 per month excluding utilities. The plaintiff was to be paid the accumulated rental in full when the first defendant vacated the premises and within seven days of a demand being made. The first defendant had vacated the premises on 16 July 2018 without notice and the accumulated rental up to that date amounted to $48,750[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

17     Despite the plaintiff’s demand dated 31 July 2019 sent by his solicitors, the first defendant had failed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $48,750 or any part thereof.

## The first defendant’s defence

### Defamation

#### No defamatory meaning

18     While the first defendant admits to the publication of the three Facebook Posts and also admits that the Posts refer to the plaintiff, he denies that they bear the defamatory meanings pleaded by the plaintiff, or any defamatory meaning at all[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17).

19     In regard to the First Omar Post, he asserts instead that the natural and ordinary meanings of the words read in the context of the Facebook profile page, “Phra Pirab Occult Specialist”, and the contents of the website known as www.prophet666.com meant and/or were understood to mean that:

> (a)     The plaintiff is not part of the “Aghori”;

> (b)     The plaintiff uses intimidation to get his way;![](data:image;base64,)

> (c)     The plaintiff drinks excessively;

> (d)     The plaintiff deceives his customers by imitating products (amulets, rituals and occult services) based on external sources and he did not conceive the said rituals and occult services himself; and

> (e)     The plaintiff falsely advertises the origins of the products he sells.

20     As for the Second Omar Post and the Third Omar Post, the first defendant similarly claims that read in the context of the “Phra Pirab Occult Specialist” Facebook profile page, and the contents of the website known as www.prophet666.com, the words meant and/or were understood to mean that the plaintiff deceives his customers by imitating products (amulets, rituals and occult services) based on external sources and he did not conceive the said rituals and occult services himself[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18).

#### Justification

21     In respect of all the three Posts, the first defendant raises the defence of justification. He says that the gist and common sting of the three publications is that the plaintiff was deceptive in the conduct of his business as evidenced by the repeated use of words like “cheat”, “conman” and the like. The common sting referring to the plaintiff’s deceptive conduct of his business dealings is true by virtue of his:

> (a)     false advertising of products containing human parts;

> (b)     false advertising of the sources of his products;

> (c)     false advertising of his self-created products to be original; and

> (d)     false claims of being an Aghori spiritual master.

22     In support of his defence of justification, the first defendant had cited various instances of what he had observed of the plaintiff’s conduct while working for the plaintiff. These included[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19):

> (a)     While the plaintiff professed to be part of the “Aghori” which is apparently known to have extreme and occasionally illegal rituals, ceremonies and activities, the first defendant had never witnessed the plaintiff ![](data:image;base64,)participating in such rituals, ceremonies or activities during the five years that he worked with the plaintiff.![](data:image;base64,)

> (b)     On or around 18 February 2013, at ![](data:image;base64,)Pearl Centre, Singapore, the first defendant had witnessed the plaintiff falsely threatening to use black magic against an individual if he failed to purchase a beer for the plaintiff.

> (c)     On or about January 2018, the first defendant chanced upon the “Prophet666” website which apparently contained detailed instructions on products such as amulets, rituals and occult services. The same products provided by the plaintiff closely followed the steps and techniques detailed on the “Prophet666” website.

> (d)     The plaintiff had been selling amulets from Thailand said to made by certain renowned masters which, if authentic, would have cost between $500 to $800. However, the plaintiff was selling them at prices of $140 and $150 only. The plaintiff had purchased the amulets in bulk from the Tha Prachan amulet market which is known to sell copies or duplicates of old amulets for a fraction of the price of the originals.

> (e)     On or around 25 May 2016, the plaintiff had posted on the Phra Pirab Facebook page a photograph with a claim that he had done a meditation known as “Shava Sadhana (Corpse Samadhi)”. The photograph had been taken by the first defendant on or around 5 May 2016 when he accompanied the plaintiff to Gorakhpur, India. At the time of taking the photograph, there was no corpse present in the vicinity and the plaintiff did not perform any meditation. The plaintiff had pretended to do the meditation and posted it on the Phra Pirab Facebook Profile.

> (f)     During the period of over five years that the first defendant worked with the plaintiff, he had witnessed the plaintiff becoming drunk during his work hours of 11am to 9pm, Mondays to Saturdays at least four times a week and making a fool of himself.

> (g)     During the period of over five years that the first defendant worked with the plaintiff, he had observed the plaintiff’s business practices such as mixing Johnson’s Baby Oil, non-alcoholic perfume and flowers and passing it off as “Attraction Oil”.

> (h)     The plaintiff had also admitted to the first defendant that he had accepted payment of $30,000 from a couple to perform rituals and prayers. There was in fact “no spiritual problem” with the couple whom the plaintiff had described as paranoid and he did not perform the said rituals and prayers.

#### Fair comment

23     The first defendant says the defence of fair comment applies to the three publications – all four requisite elements for this defence were present[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20):

> (a)     The publications were statements of opinion about the plaintiff’s improper conduct. The first defendant was airing his views with reference to pictorial evidence attached to the posts as well as his observations from having worked with the plaintiff for five years.

> (b)     The publications were a matter of public interest as the plaintiff had held himself out to be an influential religious figure and a businessman with about 40,000 followers on the Facebook platform at the time of the first defendant’s posts.

> (c)     The comments that the first defendant had made were based on facts such as the pictorial evidence given.

> (d)     The comments that the first defendant had made were such that a fair-minded and honest person could make based on the facts including the pictures attached to the Facebook posts as well as posts on various third-party forums. The first defendant had made the comments or expressions of opinion based on the facts relied on for his plea of justification _inter alia_:

>> (a)       The first defendant had honestly believed that to be an “Aghori”, one has to perform certain rituals and undergo initiation. The first defendant did not witness the plaintiff behaving like an “Aghori” and therefore believes that he cannot be deemed to be one.

>> (b)       The first defendant had witnessed the plaintiff becoming drunk in the daytime and had spent time with him when he drank large amounts of alcohol on numerous occasions. The first defendant honestly believed that this behaviour amounted to being an alcoholic.

>> (c)       The first defendant genuinely believed that the “Wealth Takrut”, “Maha Kali Wealth Kriya”, “Vashikaran Takrut” and “Kali Kriya Ritual” sold/performed by the plaintiff were reproduced from the ![](data:image;base64,)Prophet666 website as they were exact matches to the instructions and images seen on the website.

>> (d)       On the plaintiff’s sale of fake amulets, the first defendant had received a screenshot of a conversation between the plaintiff and a vendor of a stall in Tha Prachan. The messages revealed that the plaintiff was ordering a shipment![](data:image;base64,) of “Wealth Turtle” amulets for a low price. The first defendant honestly believed that a genuine “Wealth Turtle” amulet could not be bought in such large quantities for a low price.

>> (e)       The first defendant was of the opinion that the plaintiff had not performed the “Shava Sadhana (Corpse Samadhi)” as it was his understanding that a corpse had to be present when the “Shava Sadhana” to be performed. When the photograph was taken for the Facebook post on 25 May 2016, there was no corpse present.

>> (f)       On the “Attraction Oil” sold by the plaintiff, the first defendant was of the belief that the “Attraction Oil” did not have any mystical properties as the plaintiff had merely mixed the oils and did not recite any mantras or incantations while doing so.![](data:image;base64,)

>> (g)       It was the first defendant’s genuine belief that the plaintiff had accepted the sum of $30,000 from the couple (referred to in \[22(h)\] above) promising to perform rituals and prayers despite knowing that such rituals or prayers would not be beneficial to them. Further, the first defendant did not see the plaintiff perform any rituals or prayers for the couple.

### Monies had and received

24     The first defendant denies the plaintiff’s claim that he had breached his duty to the plaintiff during the period of his engagement[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21). In his closing submissions, he had also asserted that there was neither an express nor implied term of his engagement as an independent contractor of the plaintiff that he had an absolute duty to render a true and full account of all sums received for and on account of the plaintiff[^22].

25     It is the first defendant’s case that upon receiving monies from the plaintiff’s clients, he had duly accounted for, and handed over, the monies to the plaintiff promptly[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23).

### Tenancy

26     The first defendant denies that he had entered into any tenancy agreement with the plaintiff, whether written or otherwise. He states that the plaintiff had, out of his goodwill, agreed to let him stay at the residential quarters of the Business Premises as a guest. At no point during the first defendant’s stay at the residential quarters of the Business Premises did the plaintiff make known to him that he was required to pay a monthly rental of $1,500[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24).

27     The first defendant stridently denies that his signature appeared on the tenancy agreement produced by the plaintiff. A report and analysis of a handwriting expert was relied on in support of his case[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25).

## Issues

28     From the positions canvassed by the parties, the issues that the court has to determine are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the statements made by the first defendant in the First, Second and Third Omar Posts are defamatory of the plaintiff;

> (b)     If the statements are defamatory of the plaintiff, whether the first defendant can rely on justification as a defence;

> (c)     If the statements are defamatory of the plaintiff, whether the first defendant can rely on the defence of fair comment;

> (d)     If the statements are defamatory of the plaintiff, and his defences of justification and fair comment fail, the appropriate measure of damages to award to the plaintiff and other reliefs, if any;

> (e)     Whether the first defendant had failed to account for, and hand over, the sales proceeds of PPOS to the plaintiff in the total sum of $13,722; and

> (f)     Whether the first defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the sum of $48,750 as rental in arrears.

### Whether the statements made by the first defendant in the First, Second and Third Omar Posts are defamatory of the plaintiff

29     It is trite that for a plaintiff to succeed in an action in defamation, three conditions must be fulfilled:

> (a)     the statement made must bear a defamatory meaning,

> (b)     the statement must refer to the plaintiff, and

> (c)     the statement must have been published to a third party.

30     In the present case, it is not disputed that the first defendant had published the three Posts and that the three Posts refer to the plaintiff.

31     As to whether a statement is defamatory, a convenient summary is set out in _Gary Chan, The Law of Torts in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2016, 2nd Ed)_: A statement is considered to be defamatory if it tends to:

> (a)     lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally;

> (b)     cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or

> (c)     expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

32     In determining the natural and ordinary meanings of any particular publication alleged to be defamatory, the class of reader is relevant in determining the scope of possible meanings the publication may bear. See _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span> at \[18\].

33     Based on the nature and forum of the publications in the present case, I would define the class of readers of the first defendant’s Posts to be limited to Facebook users who are the plaintiff’s friends, family members, associates, customers of PPOS, persons who have an interest in the occult services offered by PPOS and potential purchasers of charms or amulets seeking information pertaining to the sale of such items.

34     In my view, the statements in the three Posts in their natural and ordinary meanings as read by the class of Facebook users described in \[33\] above meant, or would be understood to mean, that:

> (a)     the plaintiff is a fake Aghori master,

> (b)     the plaintiff practises deception on his customers as his products and services are not genuine, but fakes purchased from Thai night markets or copied by the plaintiff from Prophet666.com, an internet website on occultic practices, and

> (c)     the plaintiff is habitually drunk and uses intimidation to get others to do his bidding.

35     Although the first defendant has denied the defamatory meanings of the publications pleaded by the plaintiff and has instead proffered his own version of the natural and ordinary meanings of what he had published, in my view, the differences in the meanings ascribed by each party to the posts are not significant. Even if the court were to accept the first defendant’s version of the natural and ordinary meanings of the Posts (as pleaded in paragraph 8 of his Defence), it cannot be said that they would not lower the reputation of the plaintiff in the minds of the ordinary and reasonable reader of the three Posts:

36     By way of the First Omar Post, the first defendant had described the plaintiff as someone who was effectively passing himself off as an Aghori master when he is not one of them, has practised deception on his customers, is guilty of false advertising of his products, drinks alcohol excessively and has used intimidation to get his way.

37     The first defendant’s accusations of fraudulent conduct and deceptive business practices would undoubtedly serve to disparage the plaintiff. By any objective standards, the first defendant’s depictions of the plaintiff’s conduct and behaviour would serve to lower his reputation in the minds of the target group of Facebook users and are clearly defamatory.

38     The Second and Third Omar Posts insinuated that the plaintiff had practised deception by selling products which he had copied from a website. The use of the words “self proclaim (_sic_) master”, “fake”, “scam”, “conman”, and “thief” to describe the plaintiff would be understood by readers to mean that the plaintiff is a fraud, and that his entire business operations are fraudulent. Any argument that such descriptions would not lower the standing of the plaintiff in the minds of right-thinking members of society is totally misplaced.

39     The accusations which the first defendant made against the plaintiff and the conduct of his business in both the Second and Third Omar Posts are similar in nature to those in the First Omar Post. Accordingly, I find all three publications to be clearly defamatory of the plaintiff.

40     In his closing submissions, however, the first defendant contended that the statements made by him of the plaintiff are not defamatory because since the publication of the first defendant’s posts, the plaintiff’s reputation had in fact continually improved. This is evidenced by the increase in the plaintiff’s Facebook followers from about 40,000 to 60,000 followers. As such, no damage has been done to the plaintiff’s reputation. Furthermore, the first defendant submitted that at the time when he made the posts, the plaintiff already had a bad reputation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society. Evidence of the plaintiff’s bad reputation could be found on the internet where on-line posts made by various members of an “Amulet Forum” had expressed strong disapproval over the plaintiff’s dishonest business dealings. It was thus submitted that the first defendant’s posts did not cause, and could not possibly have caused, any further damage to the plaintiff’s reputation[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26).

41     The contentions of the first defendant are misconceived as the legal test for defamation is not whether the plaintiff’s reputation has in fact been lowered. The focus of the inquiry is on the tendency that the statements would lower the reputation of the plaintiff in the eyes of a reasonable reader. The same argument appears to have been canvassed in _Yeow Khim Seng Mark v Phan Ying Sheng_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 145</span> (“_Yeow Khim Seng Mark_”) to which the High Court (per Ang Cheng Hock J) stated at \[13\]:

> Before I proceed to consider each of the published statements in detail, I note that a common thread of the appellant’s submissions in relation to each set of statements is that the respondent’s reputation had not suffered, as she already had a poor reputation even prior to the making of the statements. I reject this submission. As I pointed out to counsel for the appellant during the hearing, the test for defamation is whether a statement _tends_ to cause the plaintiff’s reputation to be lowered in the eyes of right-thinking members of society generally. It is not whether the defamatory words _actually_ caused such lowering. Words which are defamatory of a person remain as such even if they do not really lower him in the estimation of those to whom the words were uttered: _Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[1983–1984\] SLR(R) 745</span> at \[11\].

42     Nonetheless, the arguments pertaining to the plaintiff’s alleged bad reputation prior to or at the time of the defamatory publications may have some bearing on the issue of damages that the plaintiff is claiming and will be dealt with later in this judgment.

### Whether the first defendant can rely on justification as a defence

43     It is trite that the burden is on a defendant to prove that the defamatory statements are true in substance and in fact although it would suffice to prove that the main gist of the defamatory statement is true.

44     Based on my determination of the natural and ordinary meaning of the three Posts, the gist and the common sting of the publications is firstly, that the plaintiff is a fake Aghori master, secondly that the plaintiff is deceptive or fraudulent in the conduct of his business, and thirdly, that he is habitually drunk and intimidates others.

#### Has the first defendant proven that the plaintiff’s claim of being an Aghori master is false?

45     The first defendant contends that the plaintiff had falsely claimed to be an Aghori master as he had not at any time witnessed the plaintiff performing any extreme rituals associated with the practices of an Aghori. The plaintiff had also falsely claimed to have performed a “corpse meditation” when there was in fact no corpse present.

46     To prove that the plaintiff is not an Aghori master as he claims, the first defendant referred to the internet for “the layman’s understanding of Aghori” and “recognised news sources like the BBC”[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27). Reliance was placed purely on an extract from Wikipedia as evidence of the doctrines and practices of the Aghori which include the performance of macabre rituals involving human corpses[^28]. He submitted that such practices are inseparable from the Aghori religion and contrary to those of orthodox Hinduism. As demonstrated by counsel for the plaintiff, however, Wikipedia can be easily edited by any internet user thus rendering it an unreliable source of authoritative information. See excerpt below[^29]:

> Q    Now, I want to refer you to this Wikipedia which seems to be on the way that you have gone about identifying the---the A---Aghori but I’ll ask you question first before I refer you to the document. Now, you instructed your Counsel to refer to the Wikipedia to prove your defence of justification that the Plaintiff is not an Aghori. Do you agree with me that Wikipedia is not a reliable source of information?

> A    Your Honour, I believe if the Plaintiff claims that he’s an Aghori or anything and any ordinary layman who do not know what an Aghori is will naturally google it. And when the person Google’s Aghori, Wikipedia and a few other articles will be the one that they might see. So, I mean, in---for a normal layman who do not know what is Aghori will---will definitely refer to---to this kind of articles.

> Q    Okay. Let me just give you a copy of Wikipedia that I downloaded a couple of days ago.

> …

> A    I’m---I’m sorry to interrupt but I just noticed that this link was last edited on 14th June.

> Q    Yes.

> A    2021---

> Q    Yes.

> …

> So, wait till---listen to my question. You can say whatever you want to say after I tell you what my point is, right? If you read the definition, 2nd sentence it says, “They engage in post mo---mortem rituals and are trained in the law”, can you see that? Can you see that’s what Wikipedia says?

> ..

> if you go down---further down these---their practices are sometimes considered contradictory to autocentrism and are against the practices of the Catholic Church. You go further down in that sentence it says, “They live in grand palaces and enjoy driving sports cars”. So, you will---you realise Mr.Omar, the point here, right, and you can agree or disagree with me, is that anyone can go to Wikipedia and amend and change information? That’s how Wikipedia works, right? On the 14th, you are correct, you had a good observation. On the 14th it was changed, it was changed to reflect something that is not really an Aghori. So, do you agree with me that, I will put my question to you again that Wikipedia is not a reliable source for people to understand what an Aghori is?

> A    Yes, I can agree with you.

47     It was incumbent on the first defendant to call an expert witness who could testify as to the definition, practices and doctrines of the Aghori. His reliance on Wikipedia as an authority, even if that is known to be a commonly browsed website, for the definition of an Aghori and of Aghori practices is clearly insufficient to discharge his burden of proof that the plaintiff had falsely claimed to be an Aghori master.

48     The first defendant argued that the plaintiff had not shown what it means to be an Aghori master nor demonstrated any proof that he has achieved the right to proclaim himself as such. In the plaintiff’s AEIC, however, as well as in his oral testimony, the plaintiff had challenged the first defendant’s perception obtained from online sources and explained that he is an Aghori, a devotee of Shiva, and he does not participate in activities that are extreme or illegal[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30).

49     It was pointed out that the first defendant could have contacted the spiritual headquarters of the Aghora sect in Indrapuri, Vanarasi, India to request for information about the definition of an Aghori or to enquire whether the plaintiff is in fact an Aghori. Hence, while the plaintiff has not provided any evidence of any certification of his claim to membership of the Aghori, or any sort of third-party recognition to authenticate his professed claim as an Aghori master, the onus is on the first defendant to prove the truth of his allegations in order to succeed in his defence of justification.

50     The first defendant had sought to show by way of video evidence played during the trial that the plaintiff is a person who is prone to violence and vulgar language which display of behaviour would be utterly incongruent to someone who claims to be a spiritual master. Having watched the videos played in open court, it would be fair to say that the plaintiff was shown to have displayed aggressive behaviour by hitting another person, as well as articulating a tirade of vulgarities in English and the vernacular tongue[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31).

51     While it would be generally accepted that a person who professes to be a spiritual guru or master ought not to display the type of behaviour shown in the videos, I have to agree with the submission made by counsel for the plaintiff that the court is precluded from making any finding that such behaviour would render the plaintiff unfit to be called an Aghori master. The instances shown in the videos were not pleaded as part of the particulars of the first defendant’s defence of justification.

52     In the premises, the first defendant’s defence of justification of the plaintiff’s false claim to be an Aghori master fails.

#### Has the first defendant proven that the products sold by the plaintiff are fakes?

53     The first defendant’s Posts had insinuated that the products (amulets) advertised and sold by the plaintiff were fakes which he had produced by copying from the “Prophet666” website or cheap versions that he had procured from the Thai night markets. As it is the first defendant’s case that the plaintiff has made fraudulent claims on the products sold by PPOS, the burden lies on him to adduce relevant evidence to prove the dubious provenance of the items sold by the plaintiff to justify the sting of his defamatory accusations. The first defendant has clearly failed to discharge his burden of proof:

> (a)     No witnesses were called to prove the first defendant’s claims that the amulets sold at PPOS were cheap duplicates and not sourced from the Thai temples and/or crafted by the monks as advertised and/or claimed by the plaintiff. This was despite the first defendant claiming that he had previously spoken to one of them named AJ Ruang[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32).

> (b)     All that the first defendant had adduced were a series of cropped images or screenshots of posts by unknown third parties on an internet forum (Amulet Forum) which he has not identified, all of which would amount to hearsay[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33).

> (c)     While he had adduced screenshots of his own Whatsapp conversations with one Joe Ang, purportedly an erstwhile customer of PPOS, he did not procure Joe Ang’s attendance in court to testify that he had been scammed by reason of the amulet that he purchased purportedly containing a copy of an identical “yantra” from the Prophet666.com website[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34).

> (d)     The first defendant had also included in his AEIC comparisons of pictorial representations of various products sold by PPOS which appeared to be similar to those found on Lazada.sg. During cross-examination, however, he agreed that he was not relying on any of them to prove justification[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35).

54     The first defendant submitted that the plaintiff could have furnished documents to prove the authenticity of his products such as certifications from the various temples that he claimed to have purchased the products from[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). This submission, however, turns the burden of proof on its head. It is for the first defendant, as the author of the defamatory statements, to prove the truth of his statements, _ie_ that the products sold by the plaintiff are fakes. The first defendant’s bare assertions on affidavit are simply inadequate to discharge his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.

#### Has the first defendant proven that the plaintiff was habitually drunk and intimidating others?

55     The first defendant had alleged in his Post that he had witnessed the plaintiff being habitually drunk and being delusional but no corroborating evidence has been adduced by the first defendant to prove his assertions of what he had observed over the years.

56     As for the plaintiff threatening black magic against an individual for failing to buy him beer, getting beaten up for “running his mouth”, this was apparently derived from the plaintiff’s own account to the first defendant. The first defendant had sought to rely on a Chinese newspaper report[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) which purportedly showed the plaintiff’s photograph together with a story of him getting assaulted. However, as pointed out by counsel for the plaintiff, the copy of the report was not admissible as a proper translation into the English language was not furnished to the court[^38].

### Whether the first defendant can rely on the defence of fair comment

57     As with the defence of justification, the burden of proving fair comment rests on a defendant. In order to succeed in his defence of fair comment, four elements must be established (_Chen Cheng v Central Christian Church_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 236</span> (“_Chen Cheng_”) at \[33\]):

> (a)     the words complained of are comments, though they may consist of, or include, inferences of facts;

> (b)     the comments were on a matter of public interest;

> (c)     the comments were based on facts; and

> (d)     the comments were ones which a fair-minded person could honestly make on the facts proved.

58     It is a defendant’s duty to make clear in the statements published that the words are comments and not facts by the use of appropriate words. The defence of fair comment will fail when an ordinary and reasonable reader cannot readily distinguish between comments and facts, per _Golden Season Pte Ltd v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 38</span> at \[94-95\].

59     At issue is whether the statements in the first defendant’s Posts amount to comments or assertions of fact. Much would depend on how the statements are expressed, the context in which they are set out and the content of the entire publication. While the Court of Appeal in _Chen Cheng_ at \[35\] has stated that one should adopt a common-sense approach in considering how the defamatory statements would strike an ordinary reader, it had also recognised that distinguishing between fact and comment can be a vexing issue. Hence, examples from decided cases would be helpful (see _Chen Cheng_ \[36\] to \[38\]) extracted below:

> 36    In _Hunt v The Star Newspaper Company, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1908\] 2 KB 309</span>, 319 to 320 Fletcher Moulton LJ said:

>> In the first place, _comment in order to be justifiable as fair comment must appear as comment and must not be so mixed up with the fact that the reader cannot distinguish between what is report and what is comment_: see _Andrews v Chapman_ (1853) 3 C & K 286. The justice of this rule is obvious. If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the unfavourable inference is based. But if fact and comment be intermingled so that it is not reasonably clear what portion purports to be inference, he will naturally suppose that the injurious statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer though not necessarily set out by him.

> 37    In the Australian case of _Smith’s Newspapers Ltd v Becker_ (1932) 47 CLR 279, the plaintiff sued the defendants for libel in respect of an article published in the defendant’s newspaper which defamed the plaintiff by calling him, inter alia, a “German quack”. The High Court held, inter alia, that the libellous statement was an assertion of fact. Evatt J said at 302:

>> In order to substantiate such a defence \[ie defence of fair comment\], the defendants had to show that their description of the plaintiff as a ‘German Quack’ was published as and for an expression of their opinion about him. But I am satisfied that, seen in their true relation to the article, the words ‘German Quack runs riot on the Murray Flats’ would be understood by a reader of the article as meaning, not that Smith’s Weekly were merely expressing their opinion that Becker was a ‘quack’ but that Smith’s Weekly asserted that such was a correct description of him; in other words, asserted as a fact that he was a ‘German Quack’. No doubt, the reader of the article would also gather that the writer was of opinion that Becker was a quack. But it would appear to him also that the writer did not regard such characterization as a matter open to any debate, but as a perfectly accurate portrayal of a fact.

> 38    Another clear pronouncement on statements recognisable as comment is found in the following passage of the judgment of Jordan CJ of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in _Goldsbrough v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd_ (1934) 34 SR 524 at 531:

>> For the defence \[of fair comment\] to succeed, it is essential that the whole of the words in respect of which it is relied on should be comment, that they should be fair, and that they should be on a matter of public interest. _It must be indicated with reasonable clearness by the words themselves, taking them in the context and the circumstances in which they were published, that they purport to be comment and not statements of fact; because statements of fact, however fair, are not protected by this defence._ In other words, it must appear that they are opinions stated by the writer or speaker about facts, which are at the same time presented to, or are in fact present to, the minds of the readers or listeners, as things distinct from the opinions, so that it can be seen whether the opinions are such that they can fairly be formed upon the facts: _Myerson v Smith’s Weekly Publishing Co Ltd_ 24 SR 20 at 26–27; _Cole v Operative Plasterers’ Federation_ 28 SR 62 at 67–68.

(emphasis in _italics_ mine)

60     The plaintiff submitted that the defence of fair comment was not applicable to the first defendant’s Posts because:

> (a)     The statements made by the first defendant in the three Omar Posts (that the plaintiff is a conman, and his shop is a “SCAM shop) are clearly assertions of fact similar in nature to the defamatory statement in _Chen Cheng_ that had described the church as a “_cult_”.

> (b)     Further, the first defendant had relied on the same alleged facts which were raised in his defence of justification, and he had failed to prove the truth of those facts.

> (c)     The statements made in the three Omar Posts could not be said to be comments which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved even with allowances for prejudice and exaggeration. This is evidenced from the three Omar Posts which had accused the plaintiff of committing serious fraud by the use of strong and evocative words such as “SCAM shop”, “very famous CONMAN”, “big con shop”, “cheating people”, “conman master”, and “cheating a unsuspecting couple 30K to do another fake ritual”.

> (d)     The first defendant had also failed to show that the statements in the Omar Posts were made on a matter of public interest. The mere fact that the plaintiff might have 40,000 Instagram followers is not in itself determinative of whether any alleged comment relates to a matter of public interest.

#### Are the statements made by the first defendant facts or comments?

61     I agree with the plaintiff that the statements made by the first defendant in the Posts were assertions of fact rather than comments.

62     On an examination of the entire publication in the First Omar Post, any reasonable reader would have significant difficulty distinguishing between what were statements of fact and what were comments by the publisher. Various portions of the Post were clearly assertions of fact concerning the plaintiff, such as:

> (a)     “_FAKE Aghori conman claiming himself to be BABA_”,

> (b)     “_Aghori Babaji is NOT a real aghori master. He claim to be aghori and use scare tactics to that people will believe him and feel intimidated by him. He is no other than a delusional drunkard who got exposed for asking a customer at Pearls Center to buy him beer otherwise he will curse them with black magic_.”

> (c)     “_So basically this AGHORESHWAR BABAJI from PHRA PIRAB OCCULT SPECIALIST is nothing more then a FAKE master who even went to the extend of asking his cousin to pretend to be a corpse so that he can meditate on it_ ..”

> (d)      _“Hes not even a real master to begin with..”_

> (e)     “_Aghoreshwar BABAJI is nothing but a drunkard who will drink with random customers after a few alcohol start to be emotional, cry and moan infront of everyone_…”

> (f)      _“Alcoholic and a drunkard .. Cheat people’s money to support his drinking habit and lavish lifestyle..”_

63     The descriptions given by the first defendant to the plaintiff are on a similar plane as the label of “cult” given by the defendants in _Chen Cheng._ The words “fake”, “conman”, “alcoholic” and “drunkard” would, to a reasonable reader, be in the same category as the term “quack” used in the case of _Smith’s Newspapers Ltd v Becker_ (1932) 47 CLR 279 which the High Court of Australia had held to be an assertion of fact.

64     As to the description of the plaintiff’s business (in all the three Omar Posts) as the “_biggest amulet SCAM shop in Singapore_” selling “_fake amulets_” and conducting “_fake rituals_”, these were all allegations of fact rather than comments. An appropriate analogy can be drawn to the case of _Lefroy v Burnside_ 4 LR Ir CL 556 cited in _Hunt v The Star Newspaper Company, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1908\] 2 KB 309</span> (referred to in _Chen Cheng_ at \[36\]) where the defamatory imputation was that the plaintiffs “dishonestly” and “corruptly” supplied to a newspaper certain information. The Court of Queen’s Bench in Ireland had treated the qualifications “dishonestly” and “corruptly” as comment to which Fletcher-Moulton LJ had disagreed, and opined as follows:

> In my opinion they are not comment, but constitute allegations of fact. It would have startled a pleader of the old school if he had been told that, in alleging that the defendant ‘fraudulently represented,’ he was indulging in comment. By the use of the word ‘fraudulently’ he was probably making the most important allegation of fact in the whole case. Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment.

65     While the first defendant might have intended his statements to be expressions of “his opinions about the plaintiff’s improper conduct” and he was merely “airing his views with reference to pictorial evidence attached to the posts as well as his observations from having worked with the plaintiff for five years”[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39), a reasonable reader would not understand them to be an expression of the author’s opinions. Allegations that the plaintiff was running a scam shop and selling fake amulets and performing fake rituals are, to my mind, allegations of fact. In any case, the first defendant’s failure to indicate with reasonable clearness which statements in his Posts purport to be comment and not fact would deprive him of the defence of fair comment.

#### Were the matters published in the three Posts of public interest?

66     In regard to the element of public interest, it is generally accepted that any matter affecting people at large so that they may be legitimately interested in what is going on or how they might be affected would qualify as a matter of public interest. Such matters have been held to pertain not just to matters of national importance.

67     The plaintiff has held himself out to be an influential religious figure, “with a strong reputation in the occult world”[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) and is said to have more than 47,000 followers on his personal as well as PPOS’s Facebook page. The mere fact that the plaintiff may have a significant following on his social media platform is of course not determinative of whether any alleged comment relates to a matter of public interest.

68     Matters relating to whether a church is a cult organisation (as in _Chen Cheng_), matters concerning a religious sect and its practices (see _Aaron Anne Joseph and others v Cheong Yip Seng_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 SLR(R) 258</span> have been held to satisfy the public interest requirement. Taking these case-law examples as guidance, I would agree that the first defendant’s Posts alleging the plaintiff to be a fake spiritual master and carrying on a scam occult business selling fake spiritual items and services were on matters of public interest.

#### First defendant’s “comments” made on proven facts; made fairly?

69     The first defendant had essentially relied on the same set of facts in his defence of justification to support his pleading of fair comment.

70     As I have found that the first defendant has failed to discharge his burden of proof of the facts pleaded in justification of the defamatory statements (see \[43\] to \[54\] above), it also follows that he has failed to establish the facts on which his comments are based. His reliance on “pictorial evidence” contained within the Posts is misplaced given the failure to establish the provenance of the images displayed and the credibility of the contents taken from internet sources.

71     Had the first defendant proven that the plaintiff was indeed no more than a self-proclaimed Aghori, and that the business he ran under PPOS was no more than a scam shop, the statements in the three Posts might well have been regarded as comment which an honest and fair-minded person can articulate (see _Chen Cheng_ at \[52\]). However, without a substratum of proven facts, the first defendant’s Posts can only be regarded as a tirade of baseless accusations aimed at smearing the reputation of the plaintiff.

#### Malice on the part of the first defendant

72     Even if the three Omar Posts were found to be fair comment, the plaintiff has submitted that the first defendant is nonetheless precluded from relying on the defence of fair comment as the statements made were actuated by malice.

73     In the context of the defence of fair comment, malice is established if it is shown that the defendant did not genuinely believe in what he stated when he made the defamatory statements about the plaintiff. In _Oei Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 608</span>, the Court of Appeal had endorsed the reasoning of Lord Nicholls in _Cheng Albert v Tse Wai Chun Paul_ \[2000\] 4 HKC 1 in drawing the distinction that malice plays in the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment. The Court of Appeal observed at \[52\] that in the context of the fair comment defence, the statement maker is exerting his right to express his views on a matter of public interest even though he is under no duty to do so. Hence, the defence will only hold up if the defendant “honestly believes in the views he expresses, as no one has the right to make defamatory comments on matters of public interest that he himself does not believe in”.

74     The evidence adduced from the first defendant at trial, however, showed that he did not genuinely believe that the statements in the Omar Posts were true and that he was reckless as to its truth. He had in fact published the statements out of anger and in retaliation to various statements that the plaintiff had earlier published about him.

75     The excerpts below from the cross-examination of the first defendant show that he was actuated by malice when he made the various statements in his Post[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41):

> Q    Now, next, you then go and attack, I would say impersonally by talking about his personal background, you then go on to say at 139, “Real name Rakesh Rai, black sheep on a really good and loving family. Why did you call him a black sheep?

> A    At that point of time, I did not know why I used that word.

> Q    Do you know what “black sheep” means?

> A    Yes, I know.

> …

> Q    Would you consider a black sheep meaning a member of a family or a group who is regarded as a disgrace?

> A    That’s---that’s not my understanding of a black sheep.

> Q    Sorry, can you repeat again what is your understanding of black sheep?

> A    A person that is disliked that is my understanding.

> Q    So, you wanted to say he is disliked in a---in a really good and loving family?

> A    Honestly, I did not know why I post that sentence in the first place but it’s already posted so.

> Q    And you then go on say always jealous about his friends and relatives who are doing better than him. So, again, you don’t know why you posted this?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Now, you then go on to say, “Alcoholic drunkard” I think I have done that, then you go on to say, “cheat people’s money to support his drinking habit and lavish lifestyle”, what are you talking about when you talk about his lavish lifestyle?

> A    I honestly do not know why I made these sentence at that point of time. I think maybe it could be because of anger, because he posted my picture but if you ask me now, it’s really hard for me to answer you but it’s already there.

> …

> Q    Now, I have---we have only little bit and then we are done. Next, you go on to talk about the BMW and sus--- unsuspecting couple being cheated for $30,000. Again, you don’t know, you just were overcome with emotion and you just typed this out?

> A    Yes.

> …

> Q    I put to you Mr. Omar that you’ve published the defamatory statements including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Omar post as defined in the Statement of Claim amendment number 1, maliciously and you did not genuinely believe these statements were true or you were reckless as to its truth, do you agree or disagree?

> A    I agree.

#### Defence of fair comment not made out

76     The first defendant’s defence that the three Posts amount to fair comment fails as the statements about the plaintiff are assertions of fact rather than comment. Further, the statements were made without any proven substratum of facts. While the statements might well satisfy the requirement of public interest, the evidence adduced shows that the first defendant’s publications were actuated by malice. In the premises, the first defendant’s defence of fair comment fails.

### What reliefs is the plaintiff entitled to?

#### The plaintiff’s claim for damages and injunction

77     The plaintiff asserts that the first defendant’s defamatory posts have severely undermined his reputation. He claims that he has lost much respect and goodwill from his followers and the wider public at large as a result of the Omar Posts.

78     The plaintiff contends that the allegations in the Omar Posts were serious as they had accused him, a man of business, of committing fraud. According to the plaintiff, the Posts were taken down only three to four months later.

79     Further, the first defendant has not shown any remorse towards the plaintiff throughout these proceedings. He had refused to retract the Posts even after the plaintiff had commenced this action. He had continued his smear campaign against the plaintiff and PPOS by publishing on other forums and by using aliases and other profiles. He had pleaded justification as a defence, knowing it was bound to fail since he had no evidence in support. He was also motivated by spite or his personal vendetta against the plaintiff.

80     The plaintiff also asserts that customers and members of the public have been unwilling to buy his products and services such that the sales of PPOS have decreased by more than 50% since the publications of the Omar Posts[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42).

81     In his submissions[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43), the plaintiff has asked the court to award him a total sum of $150,000 as damages with the breakdown as follows:

> (a)     General damages at $80,000

> (b)     Aggravated damages at $50,000, and

> (c)     Special damages at $20,000.

82     In addition to damages, the plaintiff submits that an injunction should be granted against the first defendant as he has clearly manifested a propensity to repeat the defamatory allegations by making further publications online as outlined below:

> (a)     On 17 August 2019, the first defendant published similar defamatory statements in the Amulet Forum about the plaintiff and PPOS under the pseudonym “_Replenish_”.

> (b)     On 2 December 2019, the first defendant created an alias, “John Claude”, and published two defamatory posts on the Facebook pages of “Singapore Biggest Thai Amulet Platform (Dealers/Collectors)” and “SINGAPORE COMPLAINT BOARD”.

> (c)     On 3 March 2020, the first defendant published a defamatory post on his blog at ‘http://ppos-scam.blogspot.com’.

> (d)     From February 2020 to March 2020, the first defendant and/or his servant or agent created an alias, “Prana Murid”, and published multiple Facebook posts defamatory of him.

> (e)     On 22 July 2020, the first defendant published several defamatory posts on the Facebook profile “Element Mustika Centipede Pearl”.

> (f)     In September 2020, a further three defamatory Facebook posts were published on the Facebook profile page “_Luklue Amulets_” and included a live video post featuring the first defendant.

83     The plaintiff contended that the first defendant had caused the above publications to be made after the Omar Posts and most were published after the commencement of this action on 6 February 2020. The plaintiff submitted that unless restrained, it is clear that the first defendant will repeat his defamatory publications.

#### The first defendant’s submissions

84     The first defendant challenges the plaintiff’s right to damages on the following grounds:

> (a)     The plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence as to how many people have seen the Posts and whether the Posts had been shared by anyone.

> (b)     The plaintiff failed to adduce any records to show that the sales of PPOS have decreased by more than 50% since the publications of his Posts.

> (c)     While the plaintiff claims to be zealously protecting his reputation, there is clear evidence from video recordings published by himself and others which show that he engages in violence in public and uses antagonistic and vulgar language. It is the plaintiff’s own such actions that has lowered him in the estimation of right-thinking members of society, caused him to be shunned or avoided and exposed himself to hatred, contempt, or ridicule.

85     As to the further publications that he had made, the first defendant maintained that he had made a post under his account “Replenish” in the Amulet Forum in response to the plaintiff’s defamatory statement accusing him of being fired for stealing. As his photograph had also been posted by the plaintiff, the first defendant had sought to clarify that what was alleged against him was untrue, and that he had resigned after coming to the realisation that the plaintiff’s business practices were dishonest.

86     The first defendant denied that the posts made under the aliases or Facebook profiles of “John Claude”, “Johnson Lin”, “Prana Murid” or “Element Mustika Centipede Pearl” had anything to do with him. As for the posts made on Luklue Amulets’ Facebook page, while the owner of Luklue Amulets is a known friend of his, he had no control over the posts made.

87     Given that the plaintiff’s reputation has already been sullied and the credibility of his claims in this action being suspect, the first defendant submitted that the appropriate quantum of damages should be a nominal $1.

#### Decision on damages

88     A plaintiff is entitled to general damages once liability for defamation has been established. General damages are not required to be proved as it is presumed at law[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44). Aggravated damages may be awarded for the enhanced hurt suffered by a plaintiff due to the defendant’s conduct and motives. They are not intended to punish the defendant, and the amount awarded must be proportionate to the award of general damages.

89     Special damages are claimable only for losses resulting from the publication of the defamatory words that are referable to the plaintiff’s reputation. To claim for special damages, the plaintiff has to show actual temporal loss, loss of some material or temporal advantage which is pecuniary or capable of being ascribed a monetary figure. No special damages will be awarded for claims for loss of sales, income or contracts where it could not be shown that the loss was caused by the defamatory words alone and where there were other possible reasons for the loss.

90     In relation to the first defendant’s argument that the plaintiff is precluded from claiming any damage done to his reputation which was already sullied by his public displays of bad behaviour, the court was referred to the rule in _Scott v Sampson_ <span class="citation">(1882) 8 QBD 491</span> which has been applied in Singapore. As damages serve to compensate the plaintiff for the harm to his reputation unaffected by the defamatory publication, in mitigating the damages, the law allows a defendant to bring evidence of the plaintiff’s general bad reputation for the ‘relevant sector of his life in issue’ and confined to the period before and at the time of the publication of the defamation.

91     However, as pointed out in the plaintiff’s further submissions, the first defendant had failed to plead in his Defence and Counterclaim any material facts as required by O 18 r 7 of the Rules of Court 2014. I agree that if it was the defendant’s intention to rely on the plaintiff’s general bad reputation in mitigation of damages, this is a material fact which has to be pleaded – the defendant ought to have pleaded the plaintiff’s general bad reputation with particulars of the specific facts to establish such bad reputation. Without such facts being pleaded, the court is precluded from making any finding as to the plaintiff’s character or bad reputation for the purposes of reducing the award of damages.

92     Even if the alleged bad reputation of the plaintiff had been pleaded, the video evidence of the plaintiff engaging in a tirade of vulgarities and assaulting another person would not be qualify as admissible under the principles set out in _Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another_ suit <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 642</span> at \[20\] namely (summarised in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore Vol 8(2A) at \[96.274\]_):

> (a)     the evidence sought to be admitted must pertain to the plaintiff’s general reputation and may not relate to specific acts of misconduct;

> (b)     the evidence of the plaintiff’s alleged general bad reputation must relate to the area or sector of the plaintiff’s character which is relevant to the defamation;

> (c)     the evidence must be of the plaintiff’s reputation prior to or at the date of the publication of the words complained of;

> (d)     evidence of rumours that the plaintiff did what was charged in the defamation is inadmissible;

> (e)     evidence of other publications to the same effect or relating to the same incident as the words complained of is inadmissible is inadmissible.

93     The evidence that the first defendant had sought to rely on were, firstly, screenshots of posts on the Amulet Forum alleging dishonesty in the dealings by PPOS[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45), and secondly the two videos which were played during the trial. The first video which had apparently been streamed on Facebook Live from the plaintiff’s Facebook page on 12 October 2020 showed the plaintiff uttering vulgarities accompanied by gestures with his middle finger while the second video dated 16 October 2020 showed the plaintiff physically assaulting another man claimed to be a customer of PPOS.

94     I had earlier found the screenshots to be inadmissible evidence as they would amount to hearsay. Given the manner in which the evidence was presented, the first defendant has also not shown how the copies of the screenshots would be admissible under the Evidence Act 1893. As for the two videos, they would be rendered inadmissible under the principles stated in \[92(a)\] and \[92(c)\] above – they portray specific acts of misconduct by the plaintiff (_viz_ spewing vulgarities and committing assault) and pertain to events in 2020 which post-date the defamatory publications made in April 2019.

95     Since any mitigation on account of the plaintiff’s alleged bad reputation is no longer applicable, the award of general damages to the plaintiff would have to be calibrated by the following factors (see _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore volume 8(2A) para \[96.247\]_):

> (a)     the nature and gravity of the defamation;

> (b)     the position and standing of the parties;

> (c)     the mode and extent of the publication; and

> (d)     the natural indignation of the court at the injury caused to the plaintiff.

96     As the defamatory statements against the plaintiff allege fraud and dishonesty in the conduct of his business, they would be regarded as serious. It is not disputed that the plaintiff is a businessman offering occult services and has a significant following on Facebook. Unsubstantiated allegations of fraudulent conduct would invariably cause serious harm to any professional, regardless of whichever field of practice – there is no basis to treat the plaintiff differently.

97     In regard to the mode and extent of the defamatory publications, the First Omar Post had been published under the Facebook profile page, Phra Pirab SCAM Specialist, which he had created on 27 April 2019. The Second and Third Omar Posts were published on a different Facebook profile page, Aghori BabaRai, also created by the first defendant on the date the publications were made, 25 April 2019.

98     While the plaintiff has submitted that the publications on Facebook would have had a greater reach than if they had been disseminated in the newspapers, he has not adduced any evidence as to the number of Facebook and/or internet users who might have seen the publications. The only documented interaction of any of the Posts is one by a user named Guna Ram who appears to have seen the post two weeks after it had been posted and reacted with the message “What the hell”.

99     The first defendant denied there was any substantial publication as both the Facebook pages had been removed quite soon thereafter. He was, however, not the one who removed them. See excerpt below[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46):

> I wish to say again that this post was made with no followers on the page and it was deleted approxi---I think if I recall correctly 1 or 2 hour after page was created. So, I don’t think more---at least I don’t think at least even 5 people came across that post.

> Q    How do you know? It’s---it’s only 5 or---or not more than 5?

> A    Because that page was not sh---it’s a page, it’s not a post. It’s a---it’s a post within a page. So, e---for example if your page have 10,000 followers when you post something then potentially it could appear in---in your followers timeline. But this page has 0 followers when it was first created. So when I made the post, nobo---e---e---it di---it didn’t appear on anybody’s timeline and the page got removed within 1 or 2 hours later. So, I don’t believe that, you know, at least 10 even 5 or 10 people saw it.

> Q    Mr. Omar, I think you are speculating here, I’ll---I’ll--I’ll leave that to submissions because it comes to the extent of damages for defamation anyways. But do you agree with me that firstly even if you put up a post and you take it down in 1 or 2 hours, the---the thing---I think it was the thing then and I think it’s the thing now.

> A    I did not take it down

> Q    A lot of people---let me---let me just finish, Mr. Omar,

> A    Okay.

> Q    A lot people can take a screenshot of the---of the post, right? Save it on their phone and even as of today they could be sharing it with people, right? Would you agree with me?

> A    Yes.

> Q    So, just because you took it down almost immediately like you say, it doesn’t mean it’s still not in distribution and a lot of people didn’t see it, correct?

> A    I can’t answer that because I’ve never seen anyone posted it online.

100    Against the first defendant’s assertions of limited publication, the plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence that the Omar Posts had in fact reached a wide audience as he claimed. While it has not been denied that the “public” settings of the two Facebook profile pages on which the three Omar Posts had been posted had the potential to reach a wide audience, the evidence adduced showed there to be only one single interaction to the Post by the user named Guna Ram. There was no evidence of the number of “likes” or “shares” or any other on-line reactions to any of the Posts unlike the situation in _Yeow Khim Seng Mark_ where clear evidence was adduced as to the number of reactions, shares and comments. See _Yeow Khim Seng Mark_ at \[86\] to \[87\].

101    The burden is on the plaintiff to adduce relevant evidence to prove the extent of the defamatory publications. See _Lee Hsien Loong v Leong Sze Hian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1128</span> at \[92\] and \[93\], where the High Court had observed that there was no evidence that the defamatory post had gone viral, _ie_ accumulating several tens if not hundreds of thousands of reactions, likes and/or shares and the plaintiff had to rely on expert evidence to establish the probability of broad circulation.

102    In the present case, while the plaintiff has shown that his Facebook profile has over 47,000 followers, there is no evidence as to how many of them, if at all, had read or accessed the Omar Posts which were on separate Facebook profile pages created by the first defendant. All that is in evidence is the plaintiff’s unchallenged assertion that he had been alerted to the Second and Third Omar Posts by his customers[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47). The number and identities of the customers have not been named. None of them had been called to testify as to what they had read. The lack of evidence in this regard lends credence to the first defendant’s belief that not more than 10 people would have seen the Posts.

103    Further, while the plaintiff had bothered to name two customers, one Mr Sunil Kumar and one Ms Natasha Stanislaus, who had intended to consult the plaintiff for his services but were turned away after having chanced upon the defamatory Posts[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48), they were not called to testify in court. There was also no direct evidence to support the plaintiff’s assertion that the defamatory Posts were only removed after three months.

104    I would therefore have to find, on the available evidence, that the extent of the publication of the defamatory statements on the Scam Facebook Profile and the Aghori Facebook profile was quite limited.

105    The plaintiff had relied on the case of _Tan Tor Teng Jerome v Koh Nai Hock_ (DC 1184/2012, unreported)[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) (“_Jerome Tan_”) in which damages in the sum of $40,000 was awarded to a professional property investment adviser. The defendant, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner, had posted on his Facebook page alleging that the plaintiff had been charged in court for offences connected with fraud, and that he was a dishonest person and a cheat. The defendant did not limit the privacy settings of his Facebook account. At the time of the defamatory post, he had about 2,921 “friends” who had direct access to his Facebook page and received updates on his posts. In reducing the quantum of damages initially awarded by a deputy registrar at $70,000 to $40,000, the district court had considered that:

> (a)     The sting of the defamatory statements was serious as they alleged that the plaintiff had been charged in court with offences connected with fraud.

> (b)     The plaintiff was a professional property investment advisor and author who conducted regular seminars in property investment to members of the public and the lack of an apology by the defendant aggravated matters.

> (c)     However, the circulation _vide_ the Facebook post would have a lesser reach as compared to cases where the publication was made in the national newspapers. Furthermore, the publication was made on the defendant’s Facebook page rather than the plaintiff’s and not all who had seen the post would have known the plaintiff. While the parties had 600 common “friends”, it was not disputed that the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence of actual damage and losses suffered.

> (d)     The transient nature of the posting as it was taken down after no more than two weeks.

106    The plaintiff submitted that the defamatory statements in the Omar Posts are of greater gravity and had caused greater harm to his reputation compared to that in _Jerome Tan_. Further, the Omar Posts were taken down around three to four months later as compared to _Jerome Tan_ which were taken down after two weeks. Also, _Jerome Tan_ had been decided in 2012 where circulation _vide_ the Facebook would have had a lesser reach as compared to the cases where the publication was made in the national newspapers. This is no longer the case now when national newspapers are also publishing their content on social media.

107    In support of his claim for aggravated damages, the plaintiff highlighted the following aspects of the first defendant’s conduct:

> (a)     He failed to make any apology or withdrawal of the Omar Posts despite receiving the letter of claim dated 31 July 2019. He had also failed to remove the defamatory Posts which were taken down by Facebook some three months later.

> (b)     He showed no remorse for the publishing of the Omar Posts and had continued his relentless smear campaign to publish similar statements on the Amulet Forum and on other Facebook pages under different aliases.

> (c)     He had unreasonably pursued the defence of justification and the evidence at trial showed that the publications of the Omar Posts were made maliciously.

108    Comparison was made to the case of _Liow Wang Wu v Pang Ah San_ (DC 2058/2014, unreported) (“_Liow Wang Wu”_) in which a district court had awarded aggravated damages of $20,000 for defamatory statements posted on the defendant’s blog. In assessing the quantum of damages, the court had considered the following:

> (a)     The defendant’s refusal to retract the libellous blogs even after the commencement of the action.

> (b)     The defendant’s plea of justification in circumstances that were bound to fail.

> (c)     The defendant’s failure to make any apology.

> (d)     The defendant was motivated by spite or personal vendetta when he made the offending words.

109    The plaintiff argued that compared to that of the plaintiff in _Liow Wang Wu_, the injury suffered was further aggravated as the first defendant has repeatedly published the libel on internet platforms commonly used by amulet enthusiasts.

110    While I accept that the nature and gravity of the defamatory publications against the plaintiff are comparable to that in _Jerome Tan_ and _Liow Wang Wu_, in terms of the standing of the plaintiff, I thought that he should be regarded more as a religious or spiritual leader rather than as a professional or businessman.

111    Looking at the digest of cases conveniently compiled in the _Practitioners’ Guide on Damages Awarded for Defamation Cases in Singapore_, Academy Publishing, 2019 (“_Practitioners’ Guide”_), a comparable libel case where religious leaders are involved is _Shanthikumar Pararajasingam v G. Kanagasingam_ DC/DC 2628/2016 (unreported) (at _Practioners’ Guide_ \[10.13\]). The plaintiff, Shanthikumar Pararajasingam, was the honorary secretary of the management committee of the Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple while the defendant, G. Kanagasingam, was a life member of the temple who was opposed to the plaintiff’s re-election as secretary of the management committee. The defendant had sent a letter to the temple alleging that the plaintiff had misused his power, committed a breach of trust and had questionable integrity as he failed to disclose to the committee material information in relation to the temple’s employment of a named individual and his stay at the temple. The words in the letter were found defamatory as they had an effect of casting doubt on the plaintiff’s integrity and aspersions on his character. The plaintiff had through his solicitors sent the defendant a letter of demand offering to waive legal costs and not proceed with his claim for damages if the defendant agreed to acknowledge and endorse an apology and undertaking which was to be circulated to the committee and temple members. The defendant rejected the plaintiff’s proposal. General damages in the sum of $10,000 was awarded to the plaintiff. No aggravated damages were awarded as the court found no malice on the part of the defendant and the full extent of the publication of the defamatory statements could not be blamed on the defendant solely.

112    While the first defendant in the present case had admitted to being reckless in the publication of his Posts, the court cannot ignore his evidence that he had been provoked by the plaintiff’s posts on 25 April 2019 alleging that he was a thief and he was essentially reacting in anger by making the Posts. The entire episode of toxic name-calling had erupted when the parties’ relationship soured in July 2018, see excerpt below[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50):

> Q    Mr. Omar, I put this to you, you can agree or disagree. Doesn’t all of this show that you basically, and I used this before and I’ll use the word because I think it’s quite apt, you went on a rampage to destroy the Plaintiff’s reputation after your relationship became soured in July 2018, correct?

> A    I disagree, may I have the opportunity to explain, Your Honour?

> …    

> I understand that Mr. Ushan is trying to say that I went on a rampage for no reason, but I wish to state clearly that since I left the Plaintiffs I did not post anything about him, I did not bothered him, but out of nowhere for some reason which I don’t know the Plaintiff posted my photo on his Facebook page at that point of time, it has 40,000 followers. He not only post my photo he also posted my friend’s photo who is in the gallery right now. Post my picture and my friend picture on his Facebook page alleging that I got fired for stealing and that I’m a thief. So, that is what led to me making all those posts that you were showing just now.

> …

> … The Plaintiff position is it’s your hatred and anger towards him that drove you, which is why malice is part of the Plaintiff’s case, right? So, we’ll come to the issues of what drove you to that, but leaving that aside, if it---you agree with me that you did essentially take it on to yourself to defend yourself on the internet.

> A    The purpose was to clarify myself of the story and to defend myself and to tell the truth about what Plaintiff is doing.

> Q    So, you call other people scammers, cheaters, drunkards to defend yourself, is that how you defend yourself?

> A    The Plaintiff did the same to me.

113    Notably, the police has not taken any further action against the first defendant based on the police reports filed and the plaintiff’s claims of misappropriation in this suit (dealt with in the next section of this Judgment) are not proven on the evidence adduced. As such, based on the entirety of the circumstances surrounding the publication of the three Posts, I find no basis to award aggravated damages.

114    While the plaintiff has also made a claim for special damages, he has conceded that there is no evidence to support his assertion that he has suffered a loss of 50% in sales since the publication of the three Posts.

115    All considered, I assess a fair award of general damages to the plaintiff in the sum of $9,000.

#### Decision on injunction

116    The plaintiff submits that an injunction against the first defendant is necessary as he has demonstrated a propensity to repeat his defamatory allegations. Further defamatory publications allegedly made by the first defendant under different pseudonyms and different Facebook profiles and online forums[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) after the publication of the three Omar Posts were adduced (see \[82\] above).

117    The first defendant has admitted to the publication in the Amulet Forum under his account named “Replenish”, the posting on his private blog and the video on the “_Luklue Amulets_” Facebook profile. He has however denied any involvement in the other posts named by the plaintiff. Without further evidence from the plaintiff, the court is unable to find that those other publications were the work of the first defendant.

118    Nonetheless, until the parties are able to amicably resolve their differences, the evidence does demonstrate the first defendant’s propensity to repeat his defamatory statements about the plaintiff and PPOS. Accordingly, I agree that it would be just and appropriate to grant an injunction restraining the first defendant from repeating his defamatory statements.

### Whether the first defendant had accounted for and handed over the sales proceeds of PPOS to the plaintiff in the total sum of $13,722

#### The plaintiff’s case

119    The plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant is for the total sum of $13,722 in respect of monies received by the first defendant for and on account of the plaintiff during the course of the first defendant’s engagement as a shopkeeper from 1 July 2013 until the termination of his services on 16 July 2018. It is alleged that the first defendant has breached his implied duty and/or implied contractual term to render a true and full account of all monies collected by first defendant to the plaintiff.

120    In support of his claim, the plaintiff relies on:

> (a)     a Letter of Agreement purportedly signed by the first defendant admitting that he had misappropriated 30 pieces of “Asura Takrut” amulets and agreeing to pay the plaintiff the sum of $9,000;

> (b)     the testimonies of three witnesses, namely Narrayana Vel s/o Ramahchandran (PW3), Akbar Yaseen s/o Mohamed Jeenah (PW4) and Mohamad Alem Bin Shaik Abdul Aziz (PW5), all of whom claim to have been customers of PPOS and had purchased specific items from the first defendant at various times;

> (c)     police reports filed by other customers of PPOS; and

> (d)     other incidents of misappropriation witnessed by Poobalan s/o Silvarajoo (PW2).

#### The first defendant’s case

121    The first defendant contended that there was no express or implied term in his engagement with the plaintiff as an independent contractor that he owed an absolute duty to the plaintiff to render a true and fair account of all sums collected regardless of the situation.

122    In fact, the first defendant’s position was akin to being an employee of the plaintiff who had always acted under the instructions of the plaintiff. The responsibility of the first defendant was to simply hand the monies collected over to the plaintiff daily when the plaintiff came to the shop which the first defendant had done faithfully.

123    It was also unreasonable to demand that the first defendant render a true and full account of monies received on account of the plaintiff when the cash register that he had set up at PPOS was old and outdated, unable to generate electronic receipts thus making it an arduous task to keep proper records.

124    Further, it was unbelievable that the plaintiff had employed the first defendant for around five years despite having suspicions about the first defendant. While the plaintiff claimed to have noticed discrepancies in 2015 and 2016 and started keeping records, yet he did not use these to confront the first defendant. As the plaintiff had installed a CCTV system in the shop in 2017, he would have had records of footage that showed anything amiss which he could have used to confront the first defendant, but he failed to produce any of these recordings. The excuse given was that the camera, the hard drive and all records had been destroyed in a fire at the premises.

125    The first defendant submitted that he had always been a trusted worker of the plaintiff who had no issues with him but was now being sued after his relationship with the plaintiff soured due to the competing business that he had set up.

126    As for the testimonies of the plaintiff’s witnesses, the first defendant questioned their credibility and independence. The first defendant also challenged the authenticity of the Letter of Agreement purportedly containing his admission.

#### My decision

127    The plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the first defendant had misappropriated the cash sales proceeds received from the plaintiff’s customers in the aggregate sum of $13,722. These were for the sale of specific items as enumerated in his statement of claim over different periods of time from 31 March 2014 at 16:05 hours up to 1 August 2018 at 00.00 hours.

128    While the first defendant had in his submissions denied any duty on his part to account to the plaintiff whether as an independent contractor or as an employee, he had admitted (in his pleaded defence) that he had been engaged as the plaintiff’s shopkeeper. As the plaintiff’s shopkeeper, he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the business.

129    Based on the first defendant’s pleaded admission that he was in charge of the day-to-day running of the business, it must follow, and it is my finding, that the first defendant had a duty to faithfully account to the plaintiff for all the sales proceeds received from the customers of PPOS.

130    The issue is whether the plaintiff has proven his case of the first defendant’s alleged misappropriation given that the plaintiff has produced no documentary records of the inventory held by PPOS during any of the periods specified in his statement of claim and the amounts stated.

131    It was only during his oral testimony that the plaintiff revealed that he had installed CCTV cameras at the business premises in 2017. But no footages of the first defendant being seen pocketing the proceeds of sale received from customers were adduced in evidence. The reason given for not doing so was that all records including the hard drive had been destroyed in a fire which the plaintiff alleged had occurred in January 2019. Not a single document was produced in court to support the plaintiff’s assertions. There was not even any report about the fire in January 2019 that purportedly destroyed all his records that was adduced by the plaintiff.

132    Notably, this incident of the fire was also not mentioned anywhere in the plaintiff’s AEIC although he referred to it during cross-examination, see extract below[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52):

> Sir, I pointed out in my AEIC that on the 2nd of January 2019, my shop there was a big fire and everything was burnt down. This was---was---this was available in the fire---SCDF’s fire report, lah. They actually had to cut into the shop to, you know, put the fire out. They destroyed everything. So, all the records, documentation, and everything I had was also gone in the same fire, which is the reason why I cannot show you the records.

##### (1)   Letter of Agreement

133    While the plaintiff claimed that all his records had been destroyed in the “big” fire of January 2019, he was surprisingly able to produce a document called the Letter of Agreement[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) pertaining to 30 pieces of “Asura Takrut” which is being relied on purportedly as an admission of misappropriation by the first defendant. The first defendant denies that he had signed the Letter of Agreement and had called a handwriting expert, Pang Chan Kok William (“DW1”), to prove that he had not signed the document in question. DW1 had given his opinion that based on his comparison of the characteristics of the first defendant’s handwriting and the signature on the Letter of Agreement, there was “strong support” for the proposition that the first defendant had not signed the Letter of Agreement[^54]. The plaintiff had not procured his own expert to challenge DW1’s opinion even though he had informed the court of his intention to do so.

134    Aside from the signature on the Letter of Agreement being challenged, the first defendant had also submitted that the contents of the document itself pointed to it being fabricated evidence. The text of the Letter which was undated stated _inter alia_:

> I admit that I had bring along the entire 30 pieces with me on the night of 7 February 2017 as I wanted to show my friends these Asura Takrut. I had misplaced it later on that night and could not find it back again.

> _I also declare that I only informed Mr Rakesh Rai about the loss of these 30 pieces of Asura Takrut given to me on the night of 7 February 2019 today which is the 17th of February 2017_.

> I was scared which is the reason why I delayed to inform Mr Rakesh of the loss.

> …

> I am also willingly providing Mr Rakesh Rai with a Picture copy of my Singapore Passport for indentification (sic) purposes as I have misplaced my Identity Card.

135    It appears from the italicised paragraph (above) of the text that the Letter had been prepared on 17 February 2017. However, the first defendant had testified that the image of his passport which was incorporated at the top portion of the Letter was from his new passport issued on 14 February 2017. He had collected his new passport from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) only on 21 February 2017.

136    The plaintiff had tried to explain that the Letter of Agreement was in fact written much later in March 2017 and not on 17 February 2017, contrary to the clear text of the Letter which he had prepared, see extract below[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55):

> Q    Okay. So---okay, this agreement s---okay, paragraph 1 of the agreement talks about the 30 pieces of Asura Takrut with each piece value at 300 SGD and was entrusted with safekeeping. And all that which is stated there on the 7th of---to the customers on the 7th of February 2017. “This batch was made on the occasion of Mr. Rakesh’s---Rakesh Rai birthday. I admit that I bring---I bring along the entire 30 pieces with me on the night of 7th February 2017.” And then it goes on to say that he had misplaced on that night and could not find it back---back again. And the crux of this is in this clause. “I also declare that I only informed Mr. Rakesh Rai about the loss of these 30 pieces of Asura Takrut given to me on the night of 7th February 2017, today, which is the 17th of February 2017.” Am I correct to say that given the fact that there is no specific date which is listed here that “today”---the agreement which says, “which is today---today which is the 17th,” that this agreement was signed on 17th? Yes?

> A    Uh, no, Your Honour. Actually, uh, that “today” refers to the date that, you know, this incident happened. But the letter was, uh, backdated, that means it was signed and printed later, but the date was to reflect the date that this incident happened and the loss was made known to me. So, that’s why there was confusion on the “today”. “Today” refers to the date that I got to know that these were misplaced. And then when the agreement was drafted and the information was put, it was backdated. This happened already in March that time when we actually prepared sign all these. It was backdated to the date that I was informed that these items had been misplaced, Your Honour.

137    I find the plaintiff’s explanation of “backdating” hard to believe. If the plaintiff had drafted the Letter of Agreement in the middle of March 2017 as he claimed, it was simply illogical that he would then have stated that the date that he was informed of the items being misplaced was “_today_ on 17 February 2017”. Given that no original of the Letter of Agreement had been produced, and in the light of the inherent contradictions as to when the Letter was prepared as well as the handwriting expert’s opinion, I am not able to rely on this document as proof of the first defendant’s admission of misappropriation in relation to the 30 pieces of “Asura Takrut”. I also found it strange, if the Letter of Agreement were genuine, why the plaintiff had not sought to enforce its express terms by claiming from the first defendant the sum of $9,000 that he had purportedly undertook expressly in writing to pay.

##### (2)   Testimonies of PW3, PW4 and PW5

138    PW3 testified that he had made purchases of 13 items totalling $2,270 from 17 April 2016 to 6 March 2017 when the first defendant was manning the plaintiff’s shop comprising the following:

> (a)     Phra Yom Amulet for $68

> (b)     Noo Nood Nom Meow Cat Amulet for $200

> (c)     7 Khodam Oil for $200

> (d)     108 Holy Blessed Oil Talisman for $280

> (e)     Prai Tong Amulet for $150

> (f)     Khun Phaen Takrut for $128

> (g)     Mit Mor Blessed Talisman for $188

> (h)     Lulok Kumanthong for $150

> (i)     LP Yai Leklai Amulet for $150

> (j)     Kumanthong Amulet for $158

> (k)     Phra Ngang Takrut for $158

> (l)     Prai Tanee Amulet for $140

> (m)     Asura Takrut for $300.

139    He was not issued any receipts for his purchases and had observed the first defendant putting the cash into his own pocket instead of the cash register.

140    In July 2018, PW3 came across a Facebook post published by the plaintiff stating that the first defendant’s services had been terminated. Sometime in late 2018 or early 2019, PW3 visited the plaintiff’s shop when he met the plaintiff for the first time and informed him regarding the first defendant putting cash into his own pocket instead of the cash register. The plaintiff suggested that he make a police report of what he had witnessed which he proceeded to do on 8 February 2019.

141    PW4’s evidence was that he had purchased six items between 31 March 2014 and 12 May 2016 totalling $1,100 from the first defendant as described below:

> (a)     Martial Arts Talisman for $200

> (b)     Tiger Spirit Amulet for $200

> (c)     Indonesia Nail for $100

> (d)     Attraction Oil for $200

> (e)     Martial Arts Talisman for $200

> (f)     Tiger Spirit Stone for $200.

142    He had also paid cash for his purchases and whenever payments were made, the first defendant would put the cash in his pocket or into a small petty cash box next to the cash register which he found to be strange. He was never issued any receipts for his purchases and found it unnecessary to demand one because he is a Muslim.

143    On 12 May 2016 while making payment for an item called Tiger Spirit Stone, PW4 asked the first defendant why the cost of the products purchased from the shop was always more than the published prices on PPOS’s Facebook page, to which the first defendant kept quiet. Subsequently, PW4 realised he had been blocked from PPOS’s Facebook page and, consequently, he stopped going to the plaintiff’s shop.

144    Sometime in 2018, PW4 saw a post on PPOS’ Facebook page stating that the first defendant had been terminated from PPOS and was no longer authorised to conduct any business dealings for PPOS. In early 2019, PW4 met the plaintiff and personally spoke to him for the first time whereby he had found out that the purchases and payments made by him were not recorded by the first defendant and that the plaintiff did not receive the monies. He then filed a police report on 11 February 2019.

145    As for PW5, he testified that he had made the following purchases totalling $2,454 since 2014 when the first defendant was the shopkeeper of PPOS:

> (a)     Pgra Ngang Amulet for $188

> (b)     Kumanthong Amulet for $128

> (c)     Mae Tong Amulet for $288

> (d)     Salika Tongkam Amulet for $208

> (e)     Arjan Nikom Medta Mahaniyom Takrut for $128

> (f)     Asura Takrut for $500

> (g)     Arjahn Nanting Flower Oil for $188

> (h)     Arjahn Apical Holy Oil for $188

> (i)     Arjah Khuntep Phra Ngang Amulet for $150

> (j)     Bulu Perindu Oil for $150

> (k)     Vashikaran Takrut for $188

> (l)     Charming Oil for $150

146    Similar to PW4, PW5 was never issued a receipt by the first defendant after his purchases. Each time PW5 paid in cash, the first defendant would “… _put it into the metal box on top of the CPU on the computer table._”[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) Further, PW5 also found out that he was charged a higher price by the first defendant than the actual sale price for most of the products purchased by him. He was then informed by the plaintiff that the first defendant had misappropriated monies from PPOS and the plaintiff had suggested that he make a police report. PW5 accordingly on 4 February 2019 proceeded to make a police report against the first defendant.

147    Bearing in mind that the allegation against the first defendant is of misappropriation, cogent evidence has to be adduced in order for the court to make a finding against him even though the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities. Despite their respective AEICs, police reports and attendances in court, I was not convinced by the testimonies of PW3, PW4 and PW5. Their independence as witnesses was significantly compromised as each of them appeared to be loyal followers of the plaintiff and had merely done his bidding by filing the police reports which were self-serving in order to align the contents with their AEICs for this suit. I found it quite incredible that despite not having any receipts for the individual items purchased they were able to recount with exactitude the prices paid for a vast number of items purchased over a considerably long lapse of time (_eg_ from 2014 in PW5’s case). There were also no pictures or photographs exhibited in any of their AEICs to provide the court with any visual appreciation of what the items were even though the items were admittedly still in their possession.

148    I highlight several other aspects of their evidence during cross-examination which affect the credibility of their stories:

> (a)     PW3 said that each time he made a purchase he would inform the Facebook page (presumably that of PPOS) that he wanted to get a certain amulet and they would “check the price and everything else”. He revealed that he had the records of his orders (on Facebook Messenger) but he had failed to disclose them.

> (b)     As for PW4, he claimed to have bought six items from the first defendant on different dates – 31 March 2014, 24 April 2014, 3 August 2014, 28 September 2014, 5 April 2019 and 12 May 2016. In his AEIC, he totalled the sum of all his purchases at $1,050 but amended that sum to $1,100 at the start of his oral testimony. He revealed that all the details were in fact given to him by PW1 from the plaintiff’s records on Facebook Messenger. However, none of those records had been produced[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57) although PW4 said that he had asked PW1 for a copy for the purposes of making his police report.

> (c)     PW4 (and the plaintiff) had also claimed the sum of $200 for a martial arts talisman which was purchased on 5 April 2019[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58). PW4 could not have been served by the first defendant on that date since he had left the plaintiff’s employment on 16 July 2018. This error (typographical or otherwise) has not been explained by the plaintiff.

> (d)     As for PW5, he was apparently unhappy with one of his amulet purchases as he had been assured that with its purchase at the hefty price of $500, he would be granted his wish to strike “4D” and any other types of gambling that he engaged in, but his wish was not granted. He gave confusing testimony as to how the first defendant had apparently taught him what to do which eventually resulted in him scoring first and second prizes on his lottery purchases but at the same time alleged that he had been cheated [\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) when he did not get his winnings. He was also unsure when he started purchasing amulets from PPOS as he had been imprisoned from 2015 to 2016 although he had affirmed in his AEIC that the purchases started from 2014.

> (e)     Having seen PW5’s AEIC, his police report and observed his demeanour in court, I found it difficult to accept his evidence as to the 12 items totalling $2,454 that he alleged the first defendant had pocketed.

##### (3)   Other customers

149    The plaintiff had listed a total of 11 of his customers that had made purchases the proceeds of which were misappropriated by the first defendant. The total sum of their purchases came up to $7,898. However, only three of them (s/no 1, 2 and 10 in PW1’s AEIC at \[37\]) had been called as witnesses.

150    The police reports of the remaining eight customers would be hearsay. No notice to admit hearsay evidence required under O 38 r 4 of the Rules of Court 2014 had been given in connection with these police reports which are accordingly inadmissible.

##### (4)   Conclusion

151    The plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proving his claim of monies had and received on account of the first defendant’s misappropriation. This claim is dismissed.

### Whether the first defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the sum of $48,750 as rental in arrears

#### The plaintiff’s case

152    The plaintiff’s pleaded claim is based on a tenancy agreement dated 1 October 2015. According to the plaintiff’s evidence, the tenancy agreement came about as follows:

> (a)     When the residential quarters of the Business Premises were vacated by the plaintiff and his family, the first defendant had requested that the premises be rented to him as it would be more convenient for him to live near the workplace. The plaintiff was prepared to rent the residential quarters to him at the market rent of about $1,800 to $2,000 per month. The first defendant negotiated for a lower rent of $1,500 per month excluding utilities as he claimed that he needed to support his younger sister who was then still studying in the polytechnic.

> (b)     However, the first defendant was unable to pay any rent then as he was facing financial hardship. He requested that he be allowed to pay all the outstanding rent together with interest when his mother (who had applied to emigrate to Canada) received her Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies after she renounced her citizenship. The first defendant’s mother, one Melissa Panthong, telephoned the plaintiff the next day. She informed the plaintiff that she would be getting married and migrating to Canada. She pleaded with him to help her son and assured him that all outstanding rent would be paid when she received her CPF monies. The plaintiff acceded to the request out of compassion.

> (c)     Subsequently, the plaintiff drafted the tenancy agreement, and the first defendant provided a copy of his mother’s passport as documentary evidence of her identity as well as a form of assurance for the payment of rent.

> (d)     The tenancy agreement was signed by both parties in the presence of witnesses, one Poobalan s/o Silvarojoo and one Mohd Faizal, the plaintiff’s brother-in-law.

> (e)     On 1 October 2015, the first defendant moved into the residential quarters together with his sister, Sarah Omar. Occasionally, the first defendant’s mother also stayed at the residential quarters. On a few occasions in 2016 and 2017, the plaintiff requested payment of outstanding rent from the first defendant and proposed to deduct the same from the first defendant’s share of the profits of the Business. However, the first defendant begged him for more time to repay the outstanding rent as his mother had yet to receive her CPF monies and he also needed monies to pay for his sister’s education.

#### The first defendant’s case

153    The first defendant denied that he had entered into the tenancy agreement with the plaintiff. His case is that the plaintiff had allowed him to stay at the premises as a guest and out of goodwill after being unable to find any tenants. The plaintiff had offered him the accommodation at the premises so that he could open the shop earlier and close it later. At the material time, the first defendant was renting a room at Choa Chu Kang with his sister who was then studying at a polytechnic.

154    The first defendant asserted that the signature appearing on the tenancy agreement is not his. He had procured the opinion of a handwriting expert to support his case.

155    As for the purported guarantee or assurance given to the plaintiff by his mother that she would settle the rentals due from the withdrawal of her CPF monies after she renounced her citizenship, the first defendant pointed out that the copy of his mother’s passport which had been incorporated in the tenancy agreement showed that she was of Thai nationality and not a Singapore citizen. Further, the plaintiff had not obtained her signature on the purported tenancy agreement which would have been crucial if she had indeed given a guarantee as claimed by the plaintiff.

156    The first defendant had also denied liability for any rental arrears on the basis of various statutory prohibitions contained in the Stamp Duties Act 1928, the Housing and Development Act 1959, the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1886 and the Civil Law Act 1909.

#### My decision

157    As the plaintiff’s pleaded claim rests on the Tenancy Agreement dated 1 October 2015, that document must first be admissible in evidence. The original of the Tenancy Agreement was not produced in court. The plaintiff has not persuaded the court as to the manner in which the document (a copy of which was exhibited to PW1’s AEIC at “RR-2 pp 48-49) is to be admitted in accordance with s 67 Evidence Act 1893.

158    Crucially, the first defendant had directed the court’s attention to the provisions of the Stamp Duties Act 1929, in particular s 42 which states:

> 42.    Except where express provision to the contrary is made in this Act, all instruments chargeable with duty and executed by any person in Singapore must be stamped before being executed.

159    The plaintiff has not contended that the Tenancy Agreement is not chargeable with duty. There is no evidence placed before the court that it has been duly stamped at any time before or even during the trial. As such, the Tenancy Agreement is inadmissible in evidence by virtue of s 52(1) Stamp Duties Act 1929 as reproduced below:

> 52.—(1)    Subject to this section, an instrument chargeable with duty must not be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties authority to receive evidence, and must not be acted upon, registered or authenticated by any such person or by any public officer, unless the instrument is duly stamped.

160    Since the tenancy agreement is rendered inadmissible, the plaintiff’s claim for any rental in arrears has to be dismissed.

161    Even if the document could be admissible as evidence (disregarding s 52A Stamp Duties Act 1929) to demonstrate the agreement and intention of the parties at the material time[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60), I am unable to dismiss the opinion of DW1 as to the authenticity of the first defendant’s signature thereon.

162    While PW2 had come forward to testify that he had seen the first defendant sign the document, I was constrained to treat his evidence with caution because:

> (a)     under cross-examination, he had stated that the first defendant was the “very last person” to sign, in which case PW2 could not be signing as a witness to the first defendant’s signature[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61);

> (b)     PW2 had not paid much attention to the document when he signed it as he claimed he had read it hurriedly[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62); and

> (c)     to PW2, the plaintiff was someone whom he treated with much respect addressing him as “Babaji” and whom he had assisted in the various rituals that the plaintiff had performed[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63). The independence and impartiality of PW2 is questionable as he would have regarded “Babaji” as someone who could do no wrong.

163    There was another witness to the signatures, one Md Faizal, said to be the plaintiff’s brother-in-law, but he did not appear in court to testify for the plaintiff. This raises further doubt as to the authenticity of the alleged tenancy agreement.

164    The plaintiff has provided no explanation as to how the surrendering of the first defendant’s mother’s citizenship would be relevant to the release of her CPF monies when it has been pointed out that his mother held Thai citizenship at the material time.

165    The plaintiff claimed that the first defendant’s mother had telephoned him to plead with him to help her son and had given her assurance that she would settle all the outstanding rent form her CPF monies. No documentary record of such a telephone conversation was adduced.

166    As the purported agreement drafted by the plaintiff was for rental to be “payable to (him) on the 1st day of each month without fail”, it begs the question why the plaintiff had not simply deducted the alleged rentals due and owing to him when he computed the sums payable to the first defendant on a monthly basis from their 70%:30% profit sharing agreement of PPOS.

167    All considered, the plaintiff’s case for outstanding rental for a period of five years simply did not add up.

168    In the premises, this head of the plaintiff’s claim has also to be dismissed.

## Conclusion

169    In summary:

> (a)     the first defendant is found liable to the plaintiff for defamation in respect of the First, Second and Third Omar Posts;

> (b)     the first defendant is to pay the plaintiff general damages in the sum of $9,000 plus interest at the usual rate;

> (c)     an injunction is granted restraining the first defendant from repeating or publishing any words similar to the First, Second and Third Omar Posts defamatory of the plaintiff;

> (d)     the plaintiff’s claim for $13,722 being the monies allegedly misappropriated or monies had and received is dismissed; and

> (e)     the plaintiff’s claim for $48,750 being arrears of rental due under the Tenancy Agreement dated 1 October 2015 is dismissed.

170    The court will hear parties on the issue of costs on a date to be fixed.
