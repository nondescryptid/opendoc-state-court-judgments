### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       Four family members (“the Plaintiffs”) claimed to have suffered broadly similar injuries following an accident on 26 March 2017 along the immigration checkpoint at the Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ Complex. The Plaintiffs were traveling back to Singapore from Johor Bahru when a vehicle driven by the defendant (“the Defendant”) collided into the rear of the Plaintiffs’ vehicle (“the Accident”) while both vehicles were awaiting in the queue to clear the Malaysian customs.

2       All four Plaintiffs sought treatment at the Mount Alvernia Hospital (“the Hospital”) the following day after the Accident and were diagnosed with Whiplash injury of Grade 1 classification under the Quebec Task Force scale. In addition, the first Plaintiff was diagnosed with a low back strain while the fourth Plaintiff was diagnosed with a back strain.

3       The Plaintiffs claimed against the Defendant in four distinct suits, which suits have all been consolidated for the hearing on assessment of damages (“the AD Hearing”).

4       In all four suits, consent interlocutory judgments have been entered against the Defendant with liability agreed at 100% but reserving the issue of costs and interest to the AD Hearing.

5       The same doctor, Dr Ho Li Chin, attended to the Plaintiffs at the Hospital and was subsequently appointed as the single joint expert (“the SJE”) in respect of all four suits.

## Issues

6       Based on the parties’ submissions, two broad issues arose for my determination:

> (a)     first, whether the Plaintiffs are able to prove that their injuries were caused by the Accident; and

> (b)     second, if causation is established, the appropriate quantum for the general damages for their respective injuries.

7       I deal with the issues in turn.

## Whether the Plaintiffs’ injuries were caused by the Accident

8       On a holistic consideration of the evidence, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved the issue of causation on a balance of probabilities in this case.

9       I first note that the Defendant had filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) in the AD Hearing, alleging, among other things, that the Accident took place at a low speed with minor damage to the two vehicles, expressly suggesting that the Plaintiffs could not have suffered any injury from the Accident. However, counsel for the Defendant, Mr Yek Nai Hui, had inadvertently omitted to inform the Defendant to turn up for cross-examination during the second tranche of the AD Hearing. Mr Yek was then given leave to call the Defendant to be heard together with the SJE on the last tranche. Regrettably however, Mr Yek again omitted to inform the Defendant of the hearing. In the circumstances, I gave Mr Yek the option of either: (a) holding a further tranche with costs on an indemnity basis to be borne by the Defendant for the further tranche; or (b) to disregard the Defendant’s AEIC out of fairness to the Plaintiffs who would not be able to cross-examine the Defendant. Mr Yek elected for the latter option and I therefore place no weight on the Defendant’s AEIC in my decision below.

10     I turn now to deal with the Defendant’s argument on causation. First, Mr Yek contends that the Plaintiffs could not have suffered the alleged injuries in the Accident because the collision took place at a low speed and was minor. This argument is however factually unsupported. As stated in the preceding paragraph, given that the Defendant’s AEIC was not admitted, there was no evidence before me of the _speed_ at which the collision took place. In any event, I note that the Defendant has rightly conceded in his written submissions that it is possible for a person to suffer an injury “even in a light collision”, citing the decision of this court in _Yap Pow Kin v Muhammad bin Johari_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 40</span> (“_Yap Pow Kin_”).[^1] As for the pertinent question of whether it is more likely than not for the Plaintiffs to suffer any injury from such a collision, in the absence of any traffic accident reconstruction expert report tendered by the Defendant (see, _eg_, _Mark Amaraganthan Selvaganthan v Cheung Man Wai_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 253</span> (“_Mark Amaraganthan_ at \[31\]), I am only guided by the opinion of the SJE in this case, who had stated in all four medical reports that the Plaintiffs had suffered their respective injuries in the Accident.

11     The SJE was however not directly cross-examined on the issue of causation, and rightly so, as this issue might exceed his scope of expertise (see _Mark Amaraganthan_ at \[31\]). Having said that, I note, insofar as it is relevant, that the SJE, when cross-examined in relation to the minimal damage caused to the Defendant’s vehicle, had confirmed that he would maintain his diagnosis of Whiplash injury for all the Plaintiffs.[^2]

12     Second, Mr Yek highlights that it is highly unlikely for all four Plaintiffs to suffer from the same injury and they have therefore either lied or exaggerated their symptoms. This argument, while attractive at face value, is however not based on any evidence before me. To the contrary, the SJE had categorically accepted that it is “less likely than not” that the Plaintiffs had lied or exaggerated about their symptoms because their complaints were verified by physical examination.[^3] In this regard, during the AD Hearing, the SJE had explained all the various tests he had performed to verify the Plaintiffs’ complaints, ranging from palpation, flexion and lateral rotational movements. He had also stated that as a doctor, he is able to look for movements such as twitching to verify a patient’s complaints. On these aspects, I reproduce below some relevant extracts during the third tranche in relation to the evidence adduced concerning the first Plaintiff:[^4]

> Q:    Reads out para 8 of the medical report. Is this what Mr Lee told you or is this something that you observed when you did the neck movements?

> A:    Observed.

> Q:    What tests did you do?

> A:    Palpation and observation of the muscle movement and twitching.

> Q:    Could you elaborate on what exactly did you do?

> A:    When the neck is moved, the movement was slow and the muscles were observed to be stiff on palpation.

> Q:    This twitching you mentioned, can it be clearly seen?

> A:    It can be seen and felt.

> Q:    From your case notes, did you mention any twitching?

> A:    Not mentioned.

> Q:    Can these symptoms be faked?

> A:    It is not easy to fake. When they fake, the whole upper body muscles will tense up as well compared to just focal muscle stiffness.

> Q:    Can it be faked, ignoring whether easy or difficult?

> A:    Possible.

> Q:    At para 10, can you describe what physical examination was done?

> A:    The muscle tone of the lower and upper back was different during movement.

> Q:    What is the significance of that?

> A:    The muscle tension was different and the movements were more difficult on the lower back compared to the upper back.

13     The above evidence stands as the _only_ expert evidence on the matter before me. It follows therefore that the Defendant is unable to highlight any other possible causes of the injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs. This is therefore not a case where it has been “proved that there \[are\] several causes” for the injuries (see _Tan Hun Hoe v Harte Denis Mathew_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 414</span> at \[47\]).

14     The only exception to the above relates to the fourth Plaintiff’s diagnosis of back strain. On this aspect, when questioned whether the fourth Plaintiff suffered the back injury from the Accident, the SJE had stated that the fourth Plaintiff’s back strain “is _equivocal_ because of her previous back condition, which is difficult to judge” \[emphasis added\].[^5] In my judgment, the SJE’s indeterminate response means that the back injury cannot be proven on a balance of probabilities as being caused by the Accident.

15     For the above reasons, having considered the evidence, especially the findings of the SJE, I find that the Plaintiffs have proven, on a balance of probabilities, that their injuries (except the back strain suffered by the fourth Plaintiff) were suffered as a result of the Accident.

## The appropriate quantum for damages

16     Turning now to the issue of the quantum of damages, I deal first with the general damages.

### General damages

#### Whiplash Grade 1 injury

17     The Plaintiffs submit $3,000 for general damages for pain and suffering for the Whiplash Grade 1 injury while the Defendant submits for an award between $100 to $200. The guidelines for Whiplash Grade 1 injury is from $5,000 to $7,000 (see Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) at p 20). However, this is where, as stated in the Guidelines, the “neck pain, tenderness and stiffness resolve completely between a few weeks and two years”.

18     I am not convinced that the present case falls within this range because the Plaintiffs were all only given medical leave for a short duration of no more than a week. None of the Plaintiffs returned for any follow-up consultation after their medical leave expired. Most importantly, the first to third Plaintiffs also confirmed going back to work after their respective periods of medical leave had expired. There is also no evidence of any residual disabilities, with all the Plaintiffs confirming in their AEICs that they have made a “full recovery” from their injuries (while the fourth Plaintiff testified before me that she still suffers from some residual pain at the time of the second tranche on 9 July 2020,[^6] I disregarded this evidence given that it contradicted her averment in the AEIC). The present case is therefore unlike a situation where the symptoms of Whiplash injury had persisted, as provided in the Guidelines (at p 20), for a few weeks to two years as one would expect in a patient who has suffered a typical Grade 1 Whiplash injury.

19     For these reasons, I disagree with the SJE’s diagnosis of the severity of the injury and, in doing so, I am in agreement with Deputy Registrar Lim Wen Juin in _Yap Pow Kin_ that “the focus should be less on the technicalities and semantics of the diagnosis and more on the degree of pain and suffering that has resulted from the injury” (at \[11\]).

20     In the context of adjudicating expert evidence, I am assisted by the guidelines laid down by the Court of Appeal recently in _Armstrong, Carol Ann (executrix of the estate of Peter Traynor, deceased, and on behalf of the dependents of Peter Traynor, deceased) v Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 133</span>:

> 90    …The court’s determination as to whether it should accept parts of an expert’s evidence (and if so which parts) is guided by considerations of consistency, logic and coherence (see _Sakthivel Punithavathi v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 983</span> at \[75\]–\[76\]). This requires a scrutiny of **_the expert’s methodology_** and the objective facts he had based his opinion upon (see the High Court decision of _PP v Choo Peng Kuen_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 230</span> at \[64\]).

> 91    …\[T\]he judge is not bound to accept any expert opinion in its _entirety_. The ultimate consideration in deciding whether to reject or accept expert evidence, and whether to do so in part or in whole, is driven by, among other things, considerations of consistency, logic and coherence, and **_with a powerful focus on the objective evidence before the court_**.

>     \[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics\]

21     Here, the SJE had admitted during cross-examination that it would not be incorrect to classify the injury suffered by the Plaintiffs as a simple “neck strain”, which is described in the Guidelines as a case where “the pain resolves in a few days with no residual disabilities” (at p 20). As for methodology, the SJE explained that the reason why he diagnosed the injuries suffered by the Plaintiffs as “Whiplash Grade 1” instead of “neck sprain” _simpliciter_ was because of the context of a road traffic accident.[^7]

22     However, given the objective evidence before the court that I have highlighted above at \[18\], the neck injury sustained by the Plaintiffs is more appropriately classified as a case where “the pain \[from the injury\] resolve\[d\] in a few days with no residual disabilities”, wherein the award ranges from $1,500 to $3,000 (see Guidelines at p 20).

23     Notwithstanding the range, the Defendant submits for an award of $100 to $200 based on the decision in _Yap Pow Kin_ where the court assessed the general damages for pain and suffering for a neck sprain at $300. In my judgment, the decision made in _Yap Pow Kin_ can be easily distinguished on its special facts – a unique finding of fact was made in that case that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was only “fleeting and insignificant” (at \[11\]). The reason why this finding was made merits closer scrutiny. The plaintiff in that case had reported in his accident statement that no one was injured in the accident. Most pertinently, this accident statement was filed only _one_ day _after_ he had seen the doctor for his injury. This turn of events enabled the court in _Yap Pow Kin_ to draw the inference that the injury suffered by the plaintiff in that case was so minor and so transient that by the next day he could forget that he had sustained an injury (see _Yap Pow Kin_ at \[8\]–\[10\]). The court in _Yap Pow Kin_ eventually made the finding of fact that the pain suffered by the plaintiff in that case “lasted no more than a day, and also that the pain was so minor as to have been forgettable” (at \[10\]).

24     There is however no factual basis for me to draw a similar conclusion in the present case. Instead, based on the evidence and the period of medical leave prescribed to the Plaintiffs in this case, the Plaintiffs are more likely than not to have suffered from the injury for at least a few days, falling squarely within the lowest end of the range in the Guidelines (at p 20). I therefore award each Plaintiff a sum of $1,500 for their neck injury.

#### Back injury

25     The next head of general damages concern only the first Plaintiff who as mentioned above at \[2\] was additionally diagnosed to be suffering from low back strain and for whom I have found that the injury was caused by the Accident. The Guidelines provide for a sum of $2,000 or less for minor back injuries where there is full recovery “within about two years” (at p 24). Taking into account the fact that the first Plaintiff returned to work after three days of medical leave[^8] such that the injury sustained is more akin to a simple contusion (see Guidelines at p 59), I award the first Plaintiff a sum of $500 for the low back strain.

### Special damages

#### Medical expenses

26     For medical expenses, there are no disputes raised by the Defendant on the respective medical expenses incurred by the Plaintiffs. Further, as the claim in medical expenses are supported by the documentary evidence, I accordingly award the medical expenses as claimed.

#### Transport expenses

27     For transport expenses, the Plaintiffs claim $40 each for the trip they made to the Hospital. The Defendant contends that no award should be made here because it is not disputed that all four Plaintiffs were driven to the Hospital by a friend referred to as “Patrick” and it would be reasonable to assume that they were similarly driven back home by Patrick after their respective consultations.[^9]

28     In my judgment, the Plaintiffs’ claim for transport expenses is unjustified for two principal reasons. First, even though special damages have to be strictly proven in order to be recoverable (see _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]), there were no receipts tendered by the Plaintiffs to evidence the costs and mode of transport taken from the Hospital back to their residence. Assuming that the Plaintiffs even took their own transport from the Hospital back to their residence, for each of them to be entitled to $40, they must have either each made _separate_ trips back from the Hospital to their residence or have taken private transport that costs $160. Both these possibilities are extremely remote.

29     Second, while I note the decision of the High Court in _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> (at \[146\]–\[147\] where the High Court followed the approach in _Siew Pick Chiang v Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 266</span> at \[83\]–\[86\] in awarding pre-trial transport expenses even where there were no available receipts), I do not find that this principle can be invoked in a case where there is a more than reasonable likelihood that the plaintiff did not spend any money on transport.

30     Here, the AEICs affirmed by the Plaintiffs did not aver that the Plaintiff took their own transport from the Hospital back to their residence. Neither was such evidence tendered before me even in the face of undisputed evidence that they all had been driven to the Hospital by Patrick, who had also visited the Hospital for consultation at the same time.[^10] I am therefore driven to conclude that the Plaintiffs were driven back to their residence by Patrick after their visit to the Hospital.

31     In the circumstances, I decline to make any award for transport expenses.

## Conclusion

32     For the above reasons, I assess the Plaintiffs’ general damages for pain and suffering for the neck injury at $1,500 and the general damages for the low back strain for the first Plaintiff at $500, award as claimed for the medical expenses, and dismiss the claim in its entirety for transport expenses.

33     I will hear parties on costs and interest and I express my appreciation to parties for their helpful submissions.
