TORT – Negligence – Causation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 4/2021 and DCA 5/2021.\]

8 March 2021

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff brought the present action against the second defendant for personal injuries that he had suffered at a work site on 4 September 2017. The plaintiff alleged that he was hit by the bucket of an excavator operated by the employee of the second defendant. A notice of discontinuance has been filed against the first defendant as according to the Plaintiff, the first defendant is under liquidation.[^1] As this was a bifurcated trial, the dispute was on the apportionment of liability between the plaintiff and the second defendant.

2       The trial took a duration of 3 days and involved a total of 5 witnesses of which 2 witnesses were for the plaintiff and 3 witnesses were for the second defendant. The 2 witnesses for the plaintiff were the plaintiff and his former co-worker, Rasel. They gave evidence by zoom from Bangladesh pursuant to a Court Order made on 5 October 2020. The 3 witnesses for the second defendant were the excavator operator/second in command supervisor Hasanuzzaman (“Hasan”), supervisor Suman Chandradas (“Chandradas”) and director of second defendant Seah Siow Huat Jeffrey (“Jeffrey”).

3       On the first day of trial, the plaintiff sought an amendment of his AEIC to reflect that he was walking towards the dump truck to collect delivery orders when the accident allegedly happened. I allowed the amendment as it clarified the position that the plaintiff was taking for the trial.

4       After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I apportioned the liability equally between the plaintiff and the second defendant. Both parties have since appealed against my decision. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Facts

### The parties

5       The plaintiff commenced work as an employee of the first defendant on 18 July 2017. On the following day, he was assigned to work for the second defendant at a work site in Punggol. Sometime towards the end of August 2017, the second defendant sent him to work at Garden Number 68, Sungei Tengah Road. This was where the accident occurred. His job and that of his co-worker, Rasel was to pack mixed fertilizers into huge bags after the fertilizers were mixed with soil using an excavator operated by Hasan. The process was that after the fertilizers were mixed with soil by Hasan using the excavator, both the plaintiff and Rasel would hold open the jumbo bags so that Hasan could use the excavator to scoop the mixed fertilizers into the bags. The plaintiff alleged that on 4 September 2017 he was struck by the bucket of the excavator and as a result, he fell down a slope and sustained injuries. He claimed that the bucket struck him as he was walking over to the dump truck to collect delivery order forms from the truck driver.

6       After the accident, Hasan contacted Chandradas and the latter conveyed the plaintiff to National University Hospital (“NUH”) to seek treatment. At NUH, X-rays were performed and the plaintiff was then discharged 4 days later on 7 September 2017.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

7       According to the plaintiff, he and Rasel were carrying out their usual work of loading the mixed fertilizer into jumbo bags on the day of the accident. At around 5pm, a dump truck had just unloaded fertilizer at the worksite. During the material time, Hasan was operating the excavator to mix fertilizer with soil.

8       As the second in command in terms of supervisory duties, Hasan had the authority to acknowledge delivery of soil and fertilizer delivered on site. The plaintiff claimed that on previous similar occasions, out of convenience, Hasan had authorised the plaintiff to collect the delivery orders from the truck drivers for Hasan to acknowledge such delivery. At the material day and time, as the plaintiff was walking towards the dump truck in order to collect the delivery orders for Hasan’s acknowledgement of the delivery, the bucket of the excavator swung left and struck the right side of the plaintiff’s body, causing him to fall 1.5 metres down a slope. As a result, he suffered serious injuries.

9       The plaintiff claimed that he shouted out loud after he was hit by the bucket of the excavator. Then he fell and rolled down the slope. Rasel, who was working a few metres away, came to his assistance. Hasan also came over to apologise and said that he made a mistake. Hasan then called Chandradas who then used a pick-up to send the plaintiff to NUH.

10     In the amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff claimed that the second defendant had breached the common law duty and/or statutory duty under section 12 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (Cap 354A, Rev Ed 2009) and Regulation 3(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations 2006.

### The second defendant’s version

11     According to Hasan who gave evidence for the second defendant, the plaintiff had tripped and fallen on his own without the bucket of the excavator having hit the plaintiff as at the time of the accident, the excavator had not been switched on.[^2] Hasan’s version was that at around 3pm on the day of the accident, the plaintiff, Rasel and Hasan were having their usual coffee break. So Hasan had turned off the excavator and they had all gone to the rest area of the work site. After resting for a while, the plaintiff said that he needed water so he took his water bottle and went to a tap at the office. Suddenly, Rasel and Hasan heard the plaintiff shout so they went towards the plaintiff to see what had happened. The plaintiff had fallen.[^3]

12     When Rasel and Hasan reached the plaintiff, Rasel asked the plaintiff what had happened. According to Hasan, the plaintiff informed Rasel that he had slipped and fallen down and it was painful and the plaintiff wanted to go to the hospital. Hasan then called Chandradas who then fetched the plaintiff to the hospital. According to Hasan, the plaintiff had informed him and Chandradas that he had slipped and fallen. [^4]

## Issues to be determined

13     In light of the conflicting versions put forth by the parties, the Court had to determine how the accident happened which in turn has a bearing on the apportionment of liability between the parties. The issues are as follows:

> a.     Did the plaintiff trip and fall on his own?

> b.     What is the apportionment of liability between the parties?

## Issue 1: Did the plaintiff trip and fall on his own?

14     There were two conflicting versions put forth by parties as regards to how the plaintiff was injured. The plaintiff’s version was that he was struck by the bucket of the excavator operated by Hasan while on the way to collect the delivery order from the truck driver so that Hasan could acknowledge delivery on the delivery order form. As a result, he fell and rolled down a 1.5 metre slope and sustained injuries. However, the second defendant’s version was that the excavator was not even in operation or switched on when the plaintiff fell as it was break time at around 3pm. The plaintiff had fallen of his own accord when he was on his way to get water to drink during the break time near the office area. The plaintiff[^5] and Hasan[^6] had drawn different diagrams as to the location of the slope, location of the filled jumbo bags, location of the rest area and the office where the plaintiff claimed that he was obtaining water to drink.

15     I found Hasan to be an excavator operator who took the necessary precautions when operating the excavator. By the Plaintiff’s own evidence, Hasan would mix the soil and fertilizer using the excavator when the Plaintiff and his co-worker, Rasel were not standing near the bags. When the excavator was being moved, both the Plaintiff and Rasel would be in front of the excavator so that Hasan could see them and avoid hitting them with the excavator[^7]. This was consistent with what Hasan had testified to be the working procedures which governed his operation of the excavator.[^8] Given these precautions taken by Hasan, the bucket of the excavator would not have hit the plaintiff.

16     The plaintiff claimed that he was struck by the left side of the excavator when he walked towards the dump truck to collect delivery orders[^9]. By the plaintiff’s own evidence[^10], he had only worked on site for 3 to 4 days prior to the accident. In comparison, Hasan had worked at the same site for far longer since February/March 2017[^11]. However, this would not necessarily mean that Hasan’s diagram of the various locations to be more accurate than the plaintiff’s version given that the accident took place in 2017, more than 3 years before the trial took place. Even if the Court were to take the plaintiff’s case at its highest and accept the plaintiff’s diagram to be more accurate, I found that the plaintiff would not have been in the swing path of the excavator when the excavator was in operation. Based on the plaintiff’s diagram as to where he was hit by the bucket, the excavator swing path would not go beyond the point where the compost pile had been marked. Hence, it was highly unlikely that the bucket would hit him unless the excavator had overswung and strayed beyond its path. But this was not the evidence of the plaintiff that the excavator had overswung and strayed from its usual path.

17     I found that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff to be unlikely caused by the bucket of the excavator hitting him. According to the documentation ranging from hospital reports[^12] to WSH incident report[^13], the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff were right shoulder soft tissue injury, lower back contusion, right middle finger fracture, neck right side injury, right hip tenderness and 1cm laceration on right power occipital region of the head. As for the fracture to the middle finger, the MRI report revealed that there was no facture or dislocation detected for the right hand.[^14]

18     The plaintiff had testified that the excavator was of a large size.[^15] Given the massive size of the excavator, the plaintiff’s injuries would be far more severe if he were indeed hit by the bucket of the excavator.[^16] I found that if the plaintiff had been hit by the swinging bucket of the excavator, he would have suffered more severe injuries such as acute fractures. In terms of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, MRI reports were produced showing that the plaintiff did not suffer any fractures to his right hand, right shoulder nor the lumbar spine. In fact, the MRI reports stated that there was nothing wrong with the plaintiff.[^17] When asked about this MRI result during cross-examination, the plaintiff insisted that the MRI reports were wrong. Subsequently, he tried to explain illogically that the MRI said that he had something wrong[^18]. I found the MRI reports to be objective evidence on which this Court could rely on to make its findings in that the plaintiff did not suffer fractures.

19     Hence, I found that the medical evidence did not support the plaintiff’s claim of having been injured due to the excavator bucket hitting him. His injuries were likely caused by his fall after having tripped himself. By his own admission, after he fell, he hit his head on some stones which would explain the 1cm laceration on his head. The other injuries were likely to have been sustained in the course of his fall and landing at the bottom of the slope of about 1.5 metres.

20     I agreed with the second defendant that the contemporaneous documents did not support the plaintiff’s claim that he was hit by the bucket of the excavator[^19]. These documents were the NUH report of 8 June 2018 by Dr Gao Yujia[^20] and the WSH incident report filed on 13 October 2017[^21] by the first defendant which was about 5 weeks after the accident.

21     After the accident, the plaintiff was hospitalised at NUH. In the report written by Dr Gao of NUH, it was stated that the plaintiff “tripped and fell”. According to NUH, Chandradas who had fetched the plaintiff to the hospital, provided the interpretation when the plaintiff was seeking treatment at NUH. I found that Chandradas, who had spoken to both the plaintiff and Hasan after the accident, gave an accurate account of what he had been told had transpired and was then captured in the NUH report. Chandradas was a truthful and candid witness. He readily admitted that he did not have personal knowledge of how the accident happened and what he knew was based on what others had told him.[^22]

22     In the WSH incident report, I noted that it was stated the plaintiff “accidentally slipped from the slope.” This document was therefore consistent with the NUH report.

23     My evaluation of Rasel’s evidence was that his evidence did not corroborate the plaintiff’s claim that the latter was struck by the bucket of the excavator. Rasel candidly testified in court and this had been similarly reflected in his AEIC at para 8 that he never actually saw the bucket of the excavator hit the plaintiff. His evidence was that the plaintiff was working a few metres away from him and whilst he was carrying out of his work, he suddenly heard the plaintiff shouting. He looked up and saw the plaintiff roll down a 1.5metre slope. I noted that Rasel readily admitted that he did not actually see the bucket hitting the plaintiff and hence, Rasel’s evidence did not support the plaintiff’s claim of having been hit by the bucket of the excavator.

24     After having found that the plaintiff had fallen of his own accord, I found that the plaintiff had fallen when he was directed by Hasan using hand gestures to collect delivery orders from the dump truck that had arrived with the compost. It was hotly contested between the parties as to whether there was delivery of compost on the day of the accident.

25     I found that although Hasan as the second supervisor in charge and was the person authorised to sign for the delivery orders of soil and compost and therefore would usually be the one to obtain the delivery orders from the lorry drivers to sign for such deliveries, there were occasions when out of convenience, Hasan would instruct the plaintiff using hand signals to obtain the delivery order forms from the lorry drivers to pass such forms to Hasan himself to sign. This was consistent with what had been stated in the WSH Incident Report. In the report, it was stated that: “On 4 September 2017, at around 4pm, the said worker Hossain Sumon was going towards the lorry driver in order to obtain his signature when he accidentally slipped from the slope.”

26     I found that there was compost delivery on the day of the accident.[^23] Although the documentary evidence adduced through Jeffrey suggested that there was no delivery of soil or compost on the day of the accident, I accepted that there were few occasions where soil or compost were delivered on days other that stated in the Purchase Orders such as those found at pages 166 and 167 of the Agreed Bundle of Documents. This could be due to urgency of the delivery or delays in the supply chain. In addition, I found that the documentation exhibited by Jeffrey were not comprehensive as he only exhibited the ones for the company known as ENVCares Pte Ltd although Hasan had testified that there were 2 companies that made such deliveries. I found that on the day of the accident, there was a delivery of either soil or compost as this has been stated in the WSH report. The plaintiff was therefore on his way to collect the delivery order for Hasan’s acknowledgement of the delivery when he slipped and fell.

## Issue 2: What is the apportionment of liability?

27     The plaintiff’s position was that the second defendant had breached statutory provisions under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and Regulations as well as common law duty owed to the plaintiff. I agreed with the second defendant that under section 60(1)(a) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act, the plaintiff did not have civil cause of action for breaches under that Act[^24]. Section 60 of the Act provides:

> **Civil liability**

> 60.-(1)    Nothing in Act shall be construed-

>> (a)    as conferring a right of action in any civil proceedings in respect of any contravention, whether by act or omission, of any provision of this Act;

>> or

>> (b)    as conferring a defence to an action in any civil proceedings or otherwise affecting a right of action in any civil proceedings.

> (2)    Subsection (1) shall not affect the extent (if any) to which a breach of duty imposed under any written law is actionable.

28     I found that the plaintiff had not proven on a balance of probabilities that the second defendant was liable under Regulation 3 of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations. Under this regulation, the employer is required to conduct a risk assessment in relation to the safety and health risks posed to any person who may be affected by his undertaking in the workplace. In the course of the trial, I did not find that there was sufficient evidence adduced to support the plaintiff’s position that there was no risk assessment conducted.

29     I found that the second defendant had a common law duty of care to the plaintiff to provide a safe system of work. This duty had been breached as it had failed to provide a safe system of work and effective, adequate supervision. I agreed with the plaintiff that the second defendant, as the de facto employer of the plaintiff, had failed to provide a safe working system for the plaintiff and was therefore liable[^25]. In this regard, I was guided by the Court of Appeal decision of _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGCA 69</span>. In _Zheng Yu Shan v Lian Beng Construction (1988) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 6</span>, VK Rajah JA (as he then was) at \[36\] referred to the decision in _Parno_ to reiterate that an employer has a duty to its employees at common law to provide “a competent staff of men; adequate material; and a proper system and effective supervision”.

30     Here, the second defendant failed to provide a safe system of work. As stated earlier, Hasan would use hand motions to signal to the plaintiff to collect delivery order forms from dump truck drivers who had arrived with deliveries of soil and fertilizer. On his way to collect the forms, the plaintiff was required to navigate a slope before collecting the forms. It was foreseeable that when doing so, the plaintiff might slip and fall on the slope. This was what happened on the day of the accident. At \[42\] of _Parno_, the Court of Appeal enunciated the following:

> “…The duty imposed on the employer is to devise a safe system of work. In coming up with a safe system of work, the employer is entitled to take into account various factors, including the employee’s experience, the employee’s job scope and _any safety considerations that may arise_.” (emphasis mine)

31     The second defendant had failed to devise a safe system of work such that the system did not entail the plaintiff having to traverse a slope to collect the forms. An example of a safe system of work would be to station a worker at the bottom of the slope who would be tasked mainly to collect and acknowledge the delivery forms from the truck drivers, leaving Hasan and the plaintiff to concentrate on their respective tasks of operating the excavator and holding open the jumbo bags respectively.

32     Given that the plaintiff had also not exercised sufficient care for his own safety, I therefore apportioned lability equally to both parties. This apportionment was based on _Xu Ren Li v Nakano (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 729</span> in which a PRC worker who had slipped and fallen on a staircase was made to bear 50% liability. In _Xu Ren Li_, the High Court found that the defendant had breached its common law duty to provide a safe place of work for its workers who were working on a Condominium that was under construction. However, the plaintiff was contributorily negligent as he was rushing down the staircase and failed to exercise care when using the staircase as he knew that the staircase was unfinished and uneven. Similarly, here, the plaintiff should have exercised care when traversing down the slope on his way to collect the delivery forms. Having worked on site for 3 to 4 days prior to the accident. He should be aware that the slope was slippery, and he was in danger of falling from a height of 1.5 metres as this was the height of the slope. In short, although I found that the second defendant was liable for breach of its common law duty, the plaintiff had also been careless and was therefore contributorily negligent. Hence, following _Xu Ren Li_, I apportioned equal liability between parties.

## Conclusion

33     In summary, I find that the plaintiff had tripped and fallen of his own accord at the accident site and was therefore contributorily negligent. However, he had tripped and fallen as he was on his way to collect a delivery order for Hasan’s acknowledgment as instructed by Hasan. Therefore, the plaintiff was injured in the course of his employment. The second defendant had the common law duty to provide a safe place of work and it had breached this duty. Hence, my decision was to apportion 50% liability to each party.

34     For the above reasons, I gave interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff with damages to be assessed by the registrar at equal apportionment of liability between the plaintiff and the second defendant. Parties were in agreement that $9,000 be awarded as costs as half of the tariff bearing in mind the Court’s apportionment of equal lability. There was no dispute as to the sum of $9,164.75 as disbursements. Therefore, I awarded the sum of $9,000 plus GST as costs of the trial and $9,164.75 as disbursements. The costs of the assessment of damages would be decided by the registrar.
