Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Road Traffic – Offences – Driving whilst under a disqualification order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9895/2020/01.\]

24 May 2021

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 35-year-old Singaporean male, had pleaded guilty before me on 7 December 2020 for driving whilst under a court’s disqualification order. Two other charges of driving without a policy of insurance in force and failing to wear a seat belt were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. I convicted and sentenced him to eight weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of 36 months.

2       On 21 December 2020, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal because he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him.

3       On the same day, I granted a stay of execution on both the sentence of imprisonment and the disqualification order pending the appeal.

## Background facts

### The Charge

4       The proceeded charge reads as follows:

### Statement of facts

5       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 7 September 2020 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence of the proceeded charge reads as follows:

>     …

> 3    On the 23rd of November 2019, at or about 5.50 p.m., the complainant, while patrolling along New Bridge Road, Singapore, spotted the defendant driving a motor car, **SDP5699U**, and subsequently stopped the defendant for seat belt offence.

> 4    Upon screening, it revealed that defendant is not a holder of a qualified Class 3 driving license. Furthermore, it was established that the defendant was driving whilst under disqualification.

> 5    Licensing Officer of Traffic Police confirmed that the defendant was disqualified by the State Courts from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months with effect from 18th September 2019 to 17th September 2020.

>     …

6       The accused admitted to the offences in respect of the two remaining charges of driving without a policy of insurance in force and failing to wear a seat belt and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is traced for non-traffic related offences. As regards his traffic related antecedents, he was previously convicted and sentenced on 18 September 2019 for an offence of dangerous driving under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276 (“RTA”). For that offence, he was sentenced to a fine of $3,750 and a DQAC of 12 months with effect from the date of sentence.

8       The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

9       The Prosecution orally submitted for a custodial sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment and a DQAC of at least 36 months.

10     The Prosecution highlighted that since the amendment of the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for s 43(4) of the RTA has been enhanced for first and repeat offenders.

11     Prior to the 2019 amendments, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. Now, the maximum prescribed punishment for a first offender is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. For a repeat offender, the maximum prescribed punishment is now a fine not exceeding $20,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 6 years or both.

12     In coming to its submissions, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Fam Shey Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 134</span> (_“Fam Shey Yee”_), which was decided under the old s 43(4) RTA. In _Fam Shey Yee_, it was held by the High Court that the usual tariff for driving under a disqualification order was four to eight weeks’ imprisonment.

13     Therefore, with the amendments, the Prosecution submitted that the starting point sentence for a first offender like the accused in the present case would now be double that of the previous sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment That is to say that in view of the recent 2019 amendments, in order to utilise the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament (See _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\]), the new starting point sentence for a first offender should now be 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

14     Moreover, the accused’s behaviour was egregious because he committed the current offence only about two months into the DQAC of 12 months imposed on him for dangerous driving. This clearly indicated that he was in blatant disregard of the court order. He was also indifferent to the nature and seriousness of his earlier offence of dangerous driving. As such, the need for both general and specific deterrence was required in the accused’s case.

## Mitigation

15     The Defence tendered a written mitigation and submitted for a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment and DQAC of 18 months.

### Circumstances leading to the commission of the offence

16     On the material day in question, the accused stated that his wife, Ms Jaiboon Piyaporny, was driving motorcar no. SDP5699U (“the motorcar”). The accused was a passenger in the motorcar.

17     While driving, the accused’s wife complained that she felt dizzy. The accused became concerned as she had fainting spells during her past pregnancy.

18     During the earlier plead guilty (“PG”) hearing on 2 November 2020, the accused had originally stated in his previous version of the mitigation plea that his wife was pregnant at the material time of the offence. Therefore, in view of her fainting spells and her pregnancy, he decided to take over the wheel and drove the motorcar instead.

19     When I highlighted to Defence Counsel that the accused’s wife could not have been pregnant on the day of the offence (i.e. 23 November 2019) as based on the medical records tendered to the court, the accused’s baby was only born on 8 October 2020. Therefore, this would have been more than 10 months prior to the baby being born. There were also no records showing that his wife was pregnant during or around the period of the offence.

20     Defence Counsel then informed me that he would take his client’s instructions and file an amended mitigation plea before the next PG hearing.

21     In the amended mitigation plea filed on 7 December 2020, the accused then said that he and his wife was trying for another baby. He was therefore doubly concerned for her at that material time as he thought that she might have been pregnant.

22     The accused therefore asked his wife to stop the motorcar for a while. Due to the heavy traffic along New Bridge Road that day as well as his inability to control his anger as he said he was suffering from anger management issues, the accused felt he needed to take over the wheel to send his wife to the doctor as soon as possible. At that time, he thought that the health of his wife and his potentially unborn child was at risk.

23     However, the accused asserted that he was stopped and arrested by the traffic police even before he could reach his destination. He had to contact his brother to send his wife home.

24     The accused’s wife did not seek any medical attention immediately. It was only until two days after the day of the offence on 25 November 2019 that she consulted a general practitioner for her complaints of headaches and nausea. The accused claimed that he could only bring her to the doctor after he was released on bail.

### Mitigating factors

25     The Defence submitted that the accused was truly remorseful for committing the offence given his early plea of guilt. The accused accepted full responsibility for his actions and was regretful. He felt that he was acting as a worried and concerned husband for his wife who might have been pregnant that day.

26     The accused was previously working as a manager of a pub. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the pub was closed. He became unemployed for a period of time.

27     In July 2020, the accused managed to find a job as a social distancing ambassador. He needed a job badly has his wife was then pregnant. She eventually gave birth to a baby girl in October 2020. His baby girl developed jaundice when she was born. As his wife is a foreigner and can only speak Thai, she is full dependent on him for a living. The accused is therefore the sole breadwinner of the family.

28     Furthermore, due to the health issues surrounding the accused’s wife, she decided to return to Thailand with the baby in December 2020. The accused, too, was diagnosed with suffering from transient insomnia by the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and sought treatment from 12 November 2019 to 24 February 2020. He was referred to a clinical psychologist for his personality and anger management issue but there was no evidence before me that he had attended such sessions for treatment.

29     Finally, the accused’s employer wrote a letter to appeal for leniency on behalf of the accused.

### Defence’s submissions on sentence

30     In its submissions on sentence, the Defence also cited _Fam Shey Yee_, which was decided under the previous s 43(4) of the RTA prior to 1 November 2019. The Defence acknowledged that the usual tariff for a first offender was previously four to eight weeks’ imprisonment.

31     The Defence further highlighted _Muhammad Saiful Bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 37</span> (_“Saiful”_) where it was held by Sundaresh Menon CJ that some specific types of mitigating and aggravating factors for a s 43(4) of the RTA offence were (at \[27\] to \[38\]\]:

> (i)     Knowledge of the disqualification order;

> (ii)     Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law;

> (iii)     Length of time from expiry of original disqualification order; and

> (iv)     Weight of surrounding circumstances.

32     Additionally, the Defence relied on the following cases decided under the old s 43(4) of the RTA where the accused had pleaded guilty as a first offender for that offence:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.5578884223155%"> <col width="46.9106178764247%"> <col width="42.5314937012598%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>No.</u></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Case Name</u></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Sentence Imposed by the court</u></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Venkatesawaran s/o Mageswaralingam</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21506-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 51</a> (<em>“Venkatesawaran”</em>)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Four weeks’ imprisonment and DQAC of 18 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Soyed Foysal Ahmed Pavel</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21806-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 131</a> (<em>“Pavel”</em>)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five weeks’ imprisonment and DQAC four years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Leow Khoon Chye</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21531-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 65</a> (<em>“Leow Khoon Chye”</em>)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five weeks’ imprisonment and DQAC four years</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

33     The Defence did not deal with the effect of the amendments made to s 43(4) of the RTA on 1 November 2019.

34     Based on the cases cited by the Defence above, whilst it conceded that the breach of the disqualification order had occurred near the beginning of the disqualification period imposed, it was important to consider the weight of the surrounding circumstances and the reason for the accused feeling compelled to drive the motorcar that day.

35     The Defence argued that this was not due to a “blatant disregard for the law and contempt for penalties imposed by the Court”. The accused felt compelled to drive out of concern for the health of his wife and a potential pregnancy. He also could not manage the stressful situation in view of the heavy traffic along the roads that day as a consequence of his anger management issues.

36     For the reasons above, the Defence urged the court to consider the case of _PP v Giuseppe De Vito_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 340</span> _(“De Vito”_) where on the day of the offence, the accused’s pregnant wife suddenly fell ill and experienced vaginal bleeding. The accused rushed his wife to get medical aid but was apprehended when he drove to the nearby petrol station to refill the nearly empty fuel tank in his car. The District Court in that case took into account those circumstances and sentenced the accused to a disqualification order that was only 1.5 times the original period.

## Decision on sentence

### The news 43(4) of the RTA with effect from 1 November 2019

37     Since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for s 43(4) of the RTA has been enhanced for first and repeat offenders. The new 43(4) states:

> (4)    If any person who is disqualified as mentioned in subsection (3) drives on a road a motor vehicle or, if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description, the person drives on a road a motor vehicle of that class or description, the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction as follows:

>> (a)     _to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both_;

>> (b)    where the person is a repeat offender, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years or to both. \[emphasis added\]

38     Prior to the 2019 amendments, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both.

39     As regards the disqualification order, s 42(1) of the RTA continues to apply. S 42(1) of the RTA states:

>     A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

40     The nature of the driving under a disqualification order offence is that it is a strict liability offence. This was held by the High Court in _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 (“_Chng Wei Meng”)_ at \[19\]. A person who drives a vehicle would invariably know whether or not he has in fact been disqualified to do so.

41     As such, the mere act of driving under a disqualification order is all that has to be proven for the offence to be made out: See \[23\] of _Saiful_.

42     Furthermore, driving under a disqualification order is a serious road traffic offence. Yong Pung How CJ said in the case of _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) at para \[43\]:

>     Driving while under disqualification is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit. Not only does it compromise the safety of our roads; it also creates problems in ensuring adequate compensation for luckless victims.

43     The rationale behind the enhanced punishment for the s 43(4) of the RTA offence is therefore unequivocally intended to protect the safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting licences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives. Moreover, a person who drives while disqualified will also not be in possession of a valid mandatory third-party insurance policy as required by s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Cap 189 (“MVA”). Such offences, if committed, are also difficult to detect and offenders are often caught red-handed where they have either been stopped for some other offences (e.g. an accident) or on the off-chance when random checks are being conducted by the traffic police. In _Chng Wei Meng_, Yong Pung How CJ reiterated at \[19\]:

>     In my opinion, there were several factors, which strongly suggested that Parliament intended liability to be strict. Firstly, is the absence of any statutory defences for s 43(4) of the Act. Secondly, as is the case for the majority of strict liability offences, the offence of driving under disqualification is not a truly “criminal” offence but one that is regulatory in nature. Thirdly, s 43(4) is clearly concerned with the protection and safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting licences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives. Further, the reality of the situation is often that a person who drives while disqualified will also not be in possession of a valid third-party insurance policy as required by s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act. Consequently, it was clear to me that the protection of public interest and the need to avoid the tremendous damage and injustice that can arise when members of the public are injured by such irresponsible drivers, mandates the reading of s 43(4) as a strict liability offence. Fourthly, I found it significant that active promotion of the observance of s 43(4) is very much dependent upon personal compliance by the individual since the traffic police are often unable, save in cases where the offender has been stopped for some other offences or on the off-chance when random checks are being conducted, to identify and stop disqualified persons from driving on the roads. Applying the reasoning of this court in _MV Balakrishnan_ (\[9\] _supra_) when construing s 35 of the Traffic Offences Act – a similar offence that deals with driving a class of motor vehicle without the requisite driving licence – the prohibited act is not one which the public can easily protect by its own vigilance. Conversely, it is no great hardship for a person who intends to drive to determine whether or not he is in fact qualified (or disqualified) to do so.

44     In the circumstances, Yong Pung How CJ held (at \[43\]) that a motorist who chose to drive whilst under a disqualification order must expect a term of imprisonment and not merely a fine. Additionally, as the motorist chose to drive in blatant disregard of the law and the authority of the courts, he can and should expect to face the full impact of the law upon him and receive enhanced custodial sentence.

45     In _Pavel_ as cited by the Defence, the legislative intent for enhancing the punishment under s43(4) of the RTA for driving under a disqualification order via the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1993 (Act 3 of 1993) was discussed. The seriousness of the offence cannot be downplayed as an offender would deliberately ignore the court’s prohibition order by taking the chance to continue driving. Such an offender is akin to being a lethal and unguided missile as well as menace on the roads. At \[24\] of _Pavel_, it was quoted:

>     As the Minister for Home Affairs, Professor S. Jayakumar, explained in moving the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1992 (Bill 37 of 1992), which proposed this enhanced punishment \[Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 January 1993) vol. 60 at col 426-428\]:

>> … There have been a number of cases ... where motorists who are disqualified by the courts from driving for committing a serious offence, have deliberately ignored the court’s prohibition and continued to drive. ...

>> According to the Traffic Police, there are more \[of\] such offenders, but it is not easy to catch them. The Traffic Police can detect them only when they are stopped for some traffic offence or when they are involved in an accident.

>> I hope Members will agree that such a driver is really a menace to all other road users. He is, in fact, a lethal, unguided missile. Moreover, when he causes an accident, the victims will not legally be covered by insurance. ...

46     Therefore, even prior to the amendments to s 43(4) of the RTA on 1 November 2019, as agreed by both the Prosecution and Defence, the usual benchmark sentence for driving under a disqualification order was already four to eight weeks’ imprisonment for a first offender as held by the High Court in _Fam Shey Yee_ at \[12\]:

>     It is also not disputed that the sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment meted out in the present case falls within the usual tariff of _four to eight weeks’ imprisonment_: see, _eg_, _Public Prosecutor v Tan Chen Chey_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 485</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Choo Puay Lan_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 64</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Fazil bin Azman_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 168</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Lian Chee Yeow Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 190</span>; and _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thiam Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 228</span>. \[emphasis added\]

47     With the 2019 amendments to the RTA, I agreed with the Prosecution that in order to utilise the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament as per the High Court’s decision of _Poh Boon_ Kiat, the new starting point sentence for a first offender like the accused here would now be double that of the previous sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment, i.e. eight weeks’ imprisonment.

48     As such, the three cases cited by the Defence (i.e. _Venkatesawaran_, _Pavel_ and _Leow Khoon Chye_) were of little assistance given that they were decided under the old s 43(4) of the RTA. They simply affirmed the previous benchmark sentence for driving under a disqualification order at between four to eight weeks’ imprisonment for a first offender.

49     Thus far, there has been no other reported decision on the new s 43(4)(a) of the RTA provision besides _PP v Muhammad Syahmi Bin Mohd Johan_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 287</span> (_“Syahmi”_) which was a case involving a youthful offender. As mentioned, the cases cited by the Defence were all pre-2019 RTA amendments.

50     At \[86\] to \[88\] of my decision in _Syahmi_, I conducted a search on the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR) for PG cases decided under the new s 43(4)(a) of the RTA for first offenders between 1 November 2019 to 7 September 2020. There were 24 cases. There were no other types of sentence imposed except a sentence of imprisonment and the median sentence was eight weeks’ imprisonment as submitted by the Prosecution. Majority of the cases (i.e. 12 cases) fell within the range of eight weeks to two months’ imprisonment period.

51     The range for the duration of the disqualification period was more varied as this typically depends on the disqualification period of the previous sentence where the disqualification order was imposed. Generally, depending on the facts of the surrounding circumstances, the disqualification order imposed for driving under a disqualification order will at least be double that of the last sentence and a period of not less than 18 months. The median disqualification period for the 24 cases was three years.

### The most appropriate sentence to impose on the accused in the circumstances

52     In coming to my decision on the appropriate sentence to be meted out on the accused, I agreed with the Defence that for s 43(4) of the RTA, it being a strict liability offence, any aggravating and mitigating factors which demonstrates the increased or decreased in culpability of an offender as stated in _Saiful_ should be considered.

#### Knowledge of the disqualification order

53     It was evident that the accused had actual knowledge of his driving under a disqualification order imposed by the court on 18 September 2019 for dangerous driving. On that occasion, the accused had pleaded guilty in court for the said offence and was sentenced accordingly. This was in any event acknowledged by the Defence.

#### Length of time from expiry of original disqualification order

54     Again, this was undisputed by the Defence that the accused had committed the offence near to the beginning of the original disqualification period. The accused was caught driving only about two months after the original disqualification order was imposed on 18 September 2019. At that time, he had only served out less than 20% of the original disqualification period.

55     This suggested a greater culpability on the part of the accused given his blatant disregard for the law by refusing to comply with the penalties imposed by the court soon after the disqualification order was meted out: See \[33\] of _Saiful_.

#### Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law

56     Whilst the Defence admitted that the accused had intentionally broken the law when he drove under a disqualification order, the Defence sought to persuade the court that the accused had compelling reasons to break the law given the circumstances at the material time.

57     I disagreed with the Defence that there were compelling reasons for the accused to break the law when he committed the offence. I will discuss this below when dealing with the reasons and circumstances where the accused said he felt compelled by the weight of the surrounding circumstances to drive under a disqualification order.

58     It is nonetheless pertinent to point out that the very reason why he was stopped by the police on the day of the offence was because he had already disregarded the law by driving without wearing a seatbelt.

#### Weight of surrounding circumstances

59     First, this was not a medical emergency as suggested by the accused. The accused’s wife was not pregnant at the material time. In his initial mitigation plea, he was untruthful in that he claimed that his wife was pregnant at that time. When questioned further, he then changed his reason in the amended mitigation plea by claiming that he thought his wife was pregnant or potentially pregnant at that time. This appeared to have been a mere afterthought in my view.

60     Even if I have given the accused the benefit of doubt and accepted the accused’s reason that he had a mistaken belief that his wife was pregnant at the material time of the offence, there was no medical evidence to show, indicate or even suggest that his wife was unwell that day which required immediate medical attention. The accused also did not show that he had exhausted all possible alternatives before deciding to drive.

61     The accused could only provide the court with a medical memo from a general practitioner which was dated two days’ after the accused was arrested for the offence. This clearly suggested that it was not a medical emergency which warranted or necessitated the accused to drive that day.

62     The accused’s excuse that he could only send her to see the general practitioner after he was released on bail cut no ice with this court. If his wife was really that ill, she would surely have required immediate medical attention on the same day rather than having to wait for him for two days before seeing a doctor.

63     In fact, the accused could not even articulate exactly when he took over the wheel of the motorcar from his wife. All he could say in his mitigation was that he coincidentally took over the wheel at New Bridge Road before he was caught shortly after along the same road for driving without wearing a seatbelt. All in all, I treated the accused’s version of the matter with great circumspect.

64     Moreover, the remaining medical documents submitted in mitigation of the accused’s wife were either during her pregnancy or post-delivery of the accused’s baby girl. These occurred way after the commission of the offence.

65     For the reasons stated above, the unique facts in _De Vito_ can certainly be distinguished from the present case.

66     Second, in respect of the accused’s medical condition, it was stated in the IMH reported dated 30 March 2020 that he was assessed to be having transient insomnia and was prescribed with sleeping aid. As stated by Dr Joseph Leong, there was no medical evidence based on his professional assessment that the accused was suffering from any severe mental illness which might require hospitalisation.

67     Although he was referred to the IMH Clinical Psychologist in view of his complaint of anger management issues, there was no evidence before the court that the accused had undergone any such psychological sessions for treatment. I could only surmise that the accused had recovered from transient insomnia after his three medical consultations at IMH on 12 November 2019, 20 December 2019 and 24 February 2020.

68     Be that as it may, the fact that the accused might have been suffering from transient insomnia at the material time of the offence did not and should not justify his action or diminish his culpability in any way for driving under a disqualification order.

69     Last but not least, I have considered the mitigating factors raised by the Defence including the accused’s contriteness by pleading guilty at the earliest available opportunity and his full cooperation rendered to the police after his arrest.

70     Having reviewed the circumstances as a whole, I was satisfied that the duration of the custodial sentence at the revised starting point sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment under the new s 43(4)(a) of the RTA for a first offender was justified. In my view, the accused had flagrantly disregarded the law when he drove while under the disqualification order.

71     As for the disqualification order, I imposed a period of 36 months’ DQAC on the accused. In doing so, I did take into account the fact that he had committed this offence quite soon after the first disqualification order of 12 months was imposed for dangerous driving. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a need for both general and specific deterrence in the accused’s case.

## Conclusion

72     To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:
