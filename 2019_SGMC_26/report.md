\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9250/2019/01.\]

10 June 2019

### District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam:

1       The accused, Syed Abdul Rahman Bin Syed Mohsin (“Syed Abdul Rahman”), claimed trial to one charge under section 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev. Ed.) (“PC”) for dishonestly misappropriating a cheque for the sum of S$140,159.54 issued in favour of the estate of Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin. At the close of the trial, I found Syed Abdul Rahman guilty and convicted him on the charge. He was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment. Syed Abdul Rahman has filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence. He was granted a stay on the execution of the sentence and is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

2       My grounds for convicting Syed Abdul Rahman, and for the sentence imposed on him, are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charge

3       The charge to which Syed Abdul Rahman claimed trial is as follows.

MCN-900346-2016

You \[...\] are charged that you, on 10 October 2011, in Singapore, did dishonestly convert to your own use movable property, _to wit_, a Citibank cheque bearing Cheque No. 9995533 for a sum of S$140,159.54 that was drawn in your favour by Navigator Investment Services Pte Ltd as payment for monies due to one Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin, by banking the said cheque into the bank account in the name of the estate of the said Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin, which account you administered, for your own use, when the said cheque was sent to you in error by the said Navigator Investment Services Pte Ltd, to whom the monies rightfully belonged, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Background Facts

4       The accused, Syed Abdul Rahman, is a 58-year old Singapore citizen, who works as an assistant cook at a stall at Lau Pa Sat. He comes from a family of seven – parents, two older brothers, two sisters and he. His parents and two older brothers had pre-deceased him. His older brother, Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin, passed away on 30 November 2010. Syed Abdul Rahman was appointed as the Administrator of his late brother, Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin’s estate. Syed Abdul Rahman, through his solicitors, extracted the Grant of the Letters of Administration for his late brother’s estate on 14 April 2011. The Schedule of Assets annexed to the Grant of the Letters of Administration listed two assets only. One was an AVIVA Insurance Investment Plan CPFOA (Account No XXX) valued at $142, 802.50. The other asset was an NTUC Insurance (DPS Scheme Policy No. XXX) valued at $53, 850.00. The net value of the estate was stated as $196,652.50.

5       On 21 December 2010, Syed Abdul Rahman received a letter from AVIVA notifying him that his late brother had an Investment Plan with AVIVA bearing Account No XXX. He was requested to produce certified true copies of the Death certificate, NRICs of the claimants and the Grant of Letters of Administration to facilitate the pay-out from this Investment Plan by AVIVA. It was explained in the letter that this account was a pure unit trust investment and quarterly fees are charged for administering the account. The letter stated that the quantum of the pay-out will be informed to him after the Grant of the Letters of Administration and the Withdrawal Instruction Form duly signed by the Administrator, are submitted to AVIVA.

6       A second letter dated 3 January 2011, was sent by AVIVA to Syed Abdul Rahman. This letter acknowledged receipt of the certified true copies of the Death Certificate and the NRIC of Syed Abdul Rahman, which were stated to have been handed over in person by Syed Abdul Rahman. The letter also stated that the market valuation of the Investment Plan as at 30 November 2010 was S$142,802.50. The letter advised that Syed Abdul Rahman should produce the Grant of Letters of Administration once obtained, so that the fund withdrawal can be effected.

7       On 19 April 2011, Syed Abdul Rahman went in person to the AVIVA office to submit the certified true copy of the Grant of Letters of Administration and the signed Withdrawal Form. An Acknowledgement Slip was issued to him by the Customer Service Representative at AVIVA. Thereafter, on 27 April 2011, Navigator Investment Services Limited, sent a letter to Syed Abdul Rahman enclosing a cheque for a sum of S$140,159.54 made payable to the estate of Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin. The cheque was subsequently deposited by Syed Abdul Rahman into the estate account with DBS on 3 May 2011. The monies were withdrawn by Syed Abdul Rahman and the estate account was closed on 10 June 2011.

8       Navigator Investment Services Limited (“Navigator”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVIVA. Navigator is the investment arm of AVIVA, and the pay-out for the late Syed Salleh Bin Syed Mohsin’s Investment Plan was made from Navigator’s account. The cheque was therefore the property of Navigator. The separation of the funds was to ensure that the clients’ monies from the investment accounts are not mixed up with the insurance monies maintained by AVIVA.

9       On 12 May 2011, Navigator received a returned cover letter dated 27 April 2011, which had accompanied the cheque sent to Syed Abdul Rahman. Checks were made by the staff of Navigator to ascertain if the cheque had been encashed. Navigator’s finance team erroneously concluded that the cheque had not been presented. Navigator then took steps to re-issue the cheque to Syed Abdul Rahman.

10     Navigator decided that the second cheque should be collected in person as the first cheque seemed to have gone astray. On 5 October 2011, two phone calls were made to Syed Abdul Rahman by one of the staff of Navigator, Adam Lum Jin Shun, instructing him to collect the cheque from Navigator’s office. On 10 October 2011, Syed Abdul Rahman collected the cheque and the accompanying letter from Navigator’s office. He signed the form to acknowledge receipt. On the same day, he opened another estate account with DBS, and deposited the cheque into the account. Thereafter, Syed Abdul Rahman withdrew most of the money from the account the next day. He used part of it to open up a food business and gave the rest to his sisters. He withdrew the rest of the monies and closed the estate account on 29 November 2011.

11     Subsequently, Navigator realised their error and another phone call was made to Syed Abdul Rahman to notify him of the double payment. On 29 January 2013, the Service Team Head, Susan Tay Chin Mei, called Syed Abdul Rahman to inform him that the second cheque had been paid in error. He was requested to repay the overpaid amount but he flatly refused stating that he had spent all the money. The phone call was followed by a letter dated 31 January 2013, from the General Counsel of Navigator to Syed Abdul Rahman, demanding repayment. When this did not elicit a response from him, Navigator’s Legal Counsel filed a police report on 19 March 2013.

#### The Prosecution’s Case

12     The thrust of the Prosecution’s case as summarised in their Closing Submissions, is that Syed Abdul Rahman had dishonestly converted the second cheque which was paid in error by Navigator, to his own use. This was done with dishonest intent i.e. knowing (or with wilful blindness to the fact) that the second was issued in error and that retaining or encashing the cheque would result in a wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to Navigator. It was submitted that the surrounding circumstances of the case clearly pointed to such dishonest intention. The Prosecution called a total of ten witnesses and relied on a series of documents to prove its case.

#### The Defence’s Case

13     The Defence’s case simply put, is that Syed Abdul Rahman did not know that there had been an over-payment by Navigator, and that he had no dishonest intention to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to Navigator, when he encashed the second cheque. He elected to give evidence from the witness stand when his defence was called, and he relied on the two written statements which he had given to the police in the course of investigations.

#### The Ancillary Hearing

14     I will first deal with the preliminary objection raised by the Defence, to the admission in evidence, seven documents tendered by the Prosecution. For ease of reference I reproduce below, the Table of Documents presented by parties in their submissions (with the description of the documents adopted from Prosecution’s submissions).

#### (a)   The challenge to admissibility

15     The Defence argued that the documents were inadmissible as the makers of the documents were not called as witnesses and the documents constituted hearsay evidence. It was further argued that the Prosecution could not avail itself of the exception to the hearsay rule contained in s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) as the specific requirements of the provision had not been satisfied.

16     The case of _Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal[^1]_ was cited by the Defence and it was contended that the Court of Appeal had held that hearsay documents may only be admitted in evidence through a witness who was either the compiler or the person who supplied the information included in a record of the documents made in the ordinary course of his trade, business, profession or other occupation. In the present case, the witness through whom the Prosecution sought to admit the documents was Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing, the Operations Manager at Navigator. She was only involved in verifying the Withdrawal Form with the attachments, which was received from Syed Abdul Rahman. She had neither compiled a record of the documents or supplied the information contained in the record. The Defence contended that the documents may not be admitted in evidence through her.

#### (b)   The Prosecution’s response

17     The Prosecution submitted that the wording of s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) was broad enough to allow the documents to be admitted in evidence. The hearsay exception contained in the provision is not limited to documents or statements tendered through the maker of the documents or the individual who has personal knowledge of the information contained in the documents. The Prosecution also submitted that the documents sought to be admitted in the present case, were letters of correspondence, acknowledgements of collection or despatch of specific properties, or standard forms prepared by Navigator, which were made in the course of the trade or business of Navigator. As such, they fell squarely within the ambit of the provision. The Prosecution cited the case of _Gimpex_ as well, but argued that it stood for the proposition that the current s 32(1)(b) is intended to expand the scope of the hearsay exception and is unfettered by any of the technical limitations contained in the old s 32(1)(b). It expressly includes “a statement made in a document that is, or forms part of, a record compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation based on information supplied by other persons”. As such, Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing, as the Operations Manager of Navigator, is the appropriate witness to produce these documents which form part of Navigator’s business records. She is also able to attest to the accuracy and the authenticity of the documents.

#### (c)   The documents are admissible in evidence

18     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I held that the documents were admissible in evidence. I relied on the seminal decision in the Court of Appeal case of _Gimpex_ for the interpretation and application of s 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).

19      _Gimplex_ was a case involving the purchase of coal of a specified quality by the plaintiffs from the defendants. Prior to delivery, the coal was certified to be of satisfactory quality by the defendants’ inspectors in the ‘Sucofindo Report’. After delivery, the plaintiff’s inspectors found the coal to be of unsatisfactory quality. In the course of the trial, the defendants sought to rely on the Sucofindo Report. The Court of Appeal considered the ambit of s 32(1)(b)(iv) to determine if the Sucofindo Report was in fact admissible. I will set out the relevant portions of the holding below.

_90_      _Be that as it may, the cases above were decided under the previous version of s 32, which does not concern us here. The current s 32(1)(b) expressly includes, “a statement made in a document that is, or forms part of, a record compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation based on information supplied by other persons” \[emphasis added\]. It would appear that Gimpex’s objection that the Sucofindo Report was made by a person without personal knowledge of the information required to make the report can no longer hold good in light of the current provision._

_91_      _It was clear from the Explanatory Statement to the Bill which eventually was enacted as EA(A) 2012 that s 32 was amended, “to expand the scope of existing exceptions, especially the exception for statements made in the course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation” \[emphasis added\]. We should add that the expansion of the scope of s 32(1)(b) was also discussed in greater detail in the Ministry of Law draft consultation paper in relation to the Bill (“the Consultation Paper”)._

_93_      _It is also apposite to note that the limitations of the old s 32(1)(b) as mentioned in the Law Reform Committee Report, were made with reference to the decision in Vaynar (see the Law Reform Committee Report at para 15). In fact, that report stated that the position on the admissibility of “composite business reports” was still unclear despite the decision of Press Automation (ibid). There is, therefore, cause to believe that the scope of the current s 32(1)(b) is meant to remove the limitations under the old law set out in Vaynar._

_94_      _We would observe that s 32(1)(b)(iv) appears to be a new subprovision which was not there in the old s 32(1)(b). However, on the face of it, s 32(1)(b)(iv) does not purport to alter the scope of the admissibility of business documents apart from making it absolutely clear that business records would also fall within the exception to the hearsay rule. This is evidenced by the Parliamentary Debates on the Bill (see above at \[77\]) where the Minister had expressly stated that, “\[t\]he business records exception in section 32(b) \[sic\] is extended”. However, the real extension of the scope of this exception to the hearsay rule would appear to lie in the last phrase of s 32(1)(b), “based on information supplied by other persons”, which qualifies all sub-paras (i) to (iv) of s 32(1)(b). This phrase is commented on by Prof Jeffrey Pinsler SC (“Prof Pinsler”) in his work, Evidence and the Litigation Process (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013) (“Pinsler”) in the context of s 32(1)(b)(iv), as follows (at para 6.008):_

_The term ‘record’ is not defined in the EA. It may consist of a single document which includes information or two or more documents which contain information. In any event, it must be compiled by a person in the ordinary course of his trade, business, profession or other occupation. There is no express requirement that the compiler and the persons who supplied the information included in the record must have personal knowledge of that information. Therefore, s 32(1)(b)(iv) is broader than the repealed s 272 of the current CPC (and its predecessor, s 380 of the former CPC), which required the supplier of information to have, or to be reasonably supposed to have had, personal knowledge concerning the facts. Moreover, where the supplier of information was merely an intermediary (as when he received information from another supplier of information, who might have been an intermediary himself), the intermediary or intermediaries had to have been acting under a duty. The absence of these requirements in s 32(1)(b)(iv) means that hearsay upon hearsay (multiple hearsay) to an unlimited degree may be admitted without safeguards concerning the knowledge of the persons involved in transmitting the information. Furthermore, the condition in the repealed s 272 that direct oral evidence of the facts would have been admissible (ie, the court could have accepted direct testimony of the facts if it had been available) is also absent from s 32(1)(b)(iv). Additionally, the protection in the repealed s 272, which precluded the admissibility of a statement in the record if the person who supplied the information did so after the commencement of investigations into the offence, has not been retained by s 32(1)(b)(iv). These omissions raise the real possibility that documentary records admitted under s 32(1)(b)(iv) may be unreliable, a particular concern where the accused has to face such evidence in criminal proceedings. … \[emphasis added\]_

_95_      _In the premises, we are of the view that the current s 32(1)(b)(iv) is prima facie broad enough to permit the admission of the Sucofindo Report for the purposes of proving that the coal shipped on board the Vessel and discharged at Karachi was of the quality stated in the report. However, this is not the end of the matter. There is still s 32(3) which requires the court to examine whether it should exercise its discretion to exclude the Sucofindo Report in the interest of justice._

20     In short, the Court of Appeal held that s 32(1)(b)(iv) permitted a record compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or occupation based on information supplied by other persons to be admitted in evidence. s 32(1)(b)(iv) did not require the person who prepared the record to have personal knowledge of the information contained therein. It was however cautioned that the Court needs to assess whether the business records in question should nonetheless be excluded in the interest of justice.

21     In the instant case, it is not disputed that Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing did not have personal knowledge of the information contained in the documents. As the Operations Manager of Navigator, she was able to tell the Court about the manner in which copies of the documents were made and kept in Navigator’s Content Management System, which is an electronic filing system, and how the physical copies of the documents were stored in the CISCO warehouse facility.[^2] She explained that her functional role in this case was that of a ‘checker’, to check and to ensure that all the processes are in place, including the submission of supporting documents, to effect the full plan account closure.[^3] I therefore accepted that it was appropriate for the documents to be produced in Court through Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing.

#### (d)   Weight accorded to the documents

22     The Court of Appeal in the case of _Gimplex_ acknowledged that the scope of s 32(1)(b)(iv) is very wide and agreed with Prof Pinsler that under the current provision, ‘multiple hearsay to an unlimited degree may be admitted without safeguards’. The Court of Appeal then agreed with Prof Pinsler’s view _that the issue in applying s 32(3) is whether admissible evidence should be excluded because other countervailing factors outweigh the benefit of having the evidence admitted_.[^4] The Court went on to specify the following guidelines.

_109_      _In particular, we think that where the hearsay evidence sought to be admitted is of limited probative value, such evidence should properly be excluded. The effect of this is that the party seeking the admission of the hearsay evidence must be able to show the court that there were certain safeguards or measures that applied to that evidence which would ensure a minimal degree of reliability. Of course, the court in doing so must bear in mind the fine line between a decision not to admit hearsay evidence (under s 32(3)) and a decision to admit the hearsay evidence but to accord it less weight (under s 32(5)). The court should not normally exercise its discretion to exclude evidence that is declared to be admissible by the EA._

23     In the present case, Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing explained over two days of her testimony in Court, about the nature of the documents and the manner in which they are stored and archived. She stated that P8I, P9I and P9AI are standard letters of correspondence prepared and sent out by Navigator. P10I is a standard form prepared by Navigator for the closure of the account. It was completed and submitted by Syed Abdul Rahman and the documents submitted were in fact verified by her. P12I and P12AI are computer generated letters and P14I is an internal check-list used to process returned mail.

24     Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing went on to explain that all the documents were scanned and stored in their Content Manager system by the document management team. After the documents were scanned, they were stored in the CISCO warehouse. The scanned document is given a serial number which corresponds to the number listed on the box in the CISCO warehouse which contains the physical document. The documents for this trial were retrieved from the warehouse based on this numbering system.

25     Having heard the evidence of Ms Lynette Foo Lee Phing, I was satisfied that the documents produced were appropriately stored and retrieved for these proceedings. I found them to be relevant and reliable and accorded full weight to them.

#### The Applicable Law

26     The offence of criminal misappropriation under s 403 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, is different from other property offences in that _the accused person initially comes across the movable property in a legally neutral manner (eg, by finding), and he subsequently forms a dishonest intention to deal with the movable property in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights of the true owner.[^5]_

27     I reproduce below, the relevant provisions governing the offence of criminal misappropriation, to illustrate the key elements of the offence.

**Dishonest misappropriation of property**

**403**.    Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.

**“Dishonestly”**

**24**.    Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

**“Wrongful gain” and “wrongful loss”**

**23**.    “Wrongful gain” is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled; “wrongful loss” is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.

_Explanation_. — A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.

28     The High Court decision in _Wong Seng Kwan v Public Prosecutor_[^6] succinctly sets out the elements of an offence under s 403 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, which the Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt.

(a)      _the movable property (“lost chattel”) must belong to some person other than the accused person;_

(b)      _there must be an act of misappropriation or conversion to his own use; and_

(c)      _the accused person must possess a dishonest intention._

29     The first two elements of the offence are largely undisputed. It was agreed that the second cheque which was issued to Syed Abdul Rahman was the movable property belonging to Navigator as it was issued out of Navigator’s account. It was not a lost chattel abandoned by the owner, Navigator. As such, it belonged to a person other than the accused.

30     It was also agreed that Syed Abdul Rahman had deposited the cheque into the estate account, thus encashing the cheque, and thereafter, he had withdrawn all the monies from the estate account and spent the money. This is clear evidence of conversion of the second cheque to his own use.

31     The only issue which remained was whether Syed Abdul Rahman possessed a dishonest intention when he encashed the second cheque and used the monies for his own purposes. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the factual issue to be decided here is whether Syed Abdul Rahman knew that the second cheque was issued in error and that he was not entitled to retain and encash the cheque for his own use. I further accepted Prosecution’s submissions that it is sufficient to prove wilful blindness on the part of Syed Abdul Rahman as the concept of wilful blindness is akin to actual knowledge and both will go towards establishing a dishonest intent.

32     The Prosecution cited the Court of Appeal decision in _Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor[^7]_ for the general principles to apply when inferring wilful blindness. The Court of Appeal in determining the issue of the applicable mens rea for the presumption under section 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) held:

_The practical reality, however, is, as Yong CJ put it in Koo Pui Fong, that “\[o\]f course, we would never have the benefit of going into the mind of another person to ascertain his knowledge and in every case, knowledge is a fact that has to be inferred from the circumstances” ((\[103\] supra) at \[14\]; see also the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of Tay Kah Tiang v PP <span class="citation">\[2001\] 1 SLR(R) 577</span> (“Tay Kah Tiang”) at \[34\]). Likewise, a finding of wilful blindness is “solely dependent on the relevant inferences to be drawn by the trial judge from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, giving due weight, where necessary, to the credibility of the witnesses” (per Abdul Malik Ishak J in the Malaysian High Court decision of Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok An <span class="citation">\[1996\] 1 MLJ 89</span> at 101; see also per Lord Esher MR in the English Court of Appeal decision of The English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Company, Limited v Brunton <span class="citation">\[1892\] 2 QB 700</span> at 708 (“Brunton”) (the relevant passage of which is quoted at \[109\] below)). Indeed, short of a clear admission (which will, in the nature of things, be extremely rare), inferences drawn from the precise facts and circumstances of the case concerned are the only viable material available to the court in order to ascertain whether or not either actual knowledge or wilful blindness exists. It is, at this juncture, important to note, once again, that wilful blindness has always been treated, in law, as the equivalent of actual knowledge_ …

33     I turn now to address the factual issues bearing in mind the applicable principles for determining the element of knowledge of an accused person, as set out by the Court of Appeal in the case above.

#### Issues before the Court

34     The single factual issue which remains to be determined is:

#### i.   Whether Syed Abdul Rahman knew that the second cheque was issued in error and that he was not entitled to retain and encash the cheque for his own use.

35     As stated by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor_, the element of knowledge of an accused person – either actual knowledge or wilful blindness – will have to be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case. For the present case, the facts relating to three key areas of evidence, need to be carefully examined. The first is Syed Abdul Rahman’s telephone conversations with the staff of Navigator, prior to his visit to Navigator’s office to collect the second cheque. Next, is his visit to Navigator’s office and his interaction with the staff at Navigator. Third, is the set documents obtained by Syed Abdul Rahman, which includes the probate documents appointing him as the administrator of the estate, as well as the correspondence and the forms received from Navigator. I will deal with each of the three areas separately.

#### (a)   Telephone conversations with Lum Jin Shun Adam

36     Mr Lum was an administrative officer with Navigator. On 5 October 2011 at 6.27 pm, Mr Lum had called Syed Abdul Rahman to inform him that a second cheque was being prepared to replace the first cheque. The transcript of the telephone conversation was admitted in evidence. Mr Lum began by identifying himself as Adam from Navigator. Syed Abdul Rahman acknowledged his identity with a “Yes, Yes, Yes”. Mr Lum followed by explaining the purpose of his call. I will reproduce below the transcript of the call for clarity. W refers to Mr Lum and D refers to Syed Abdul Rahman.

37     This phone conversation was followed by a second phone conversation between Mr Lum and Syed Abdul Rahman when Mr Lum called back on the same day at 6.36 pm. Mr Lum informed Syed Abdul Rahman to collect the cheque on the following Monday, 10 October 2011, from the customer service centre at SGX from about 12.00 pm onwards. He was instructed to approach the receptionist when he arrives and to also bring along his NRIC for verification purposes. The transcript of this phone conversation is reproduced below as well.

38     There are several observations to be made about the two telephone conversations. First, Syed Abdul Rahman does not hesitate to seek clarification if the details are not clear or to ask Mr Lum to repeat if he can’t hear him well. When Mr Lum first introduces himself as _“Adam Calling from AVIVA Navigator”_, Syed Abdul Rahman responds with a, _“From where?”_ Likewise, after Mr Lum informs him that a new cheque will be issued which Syed Abdul Rahman needs to collect in person from the customer service centre, Syed Abdul Rahman’s response was, _“Okay can tomorrow ah?”_. He even went to the extent of asking how much was the amount in the cheque. When he was told, he responded with an _“Oo”_. There was no indication from Syed Abdul Rahman that he had not heard or understood the information told to him by Mr Lum.

39     It is evident from the transcript, as well as the audio recording played in Court, that the information given by Mr Lum was stated clearly and there was nothing confusing about what was said or the manner in which it was said. He spoke in simple English, pausing several times with an _“ah”_ or an _“ok”_ and even repeating words, an example of which is, “_Okay ah because_ **_the the_** _document was actually returned …”_. I therefore found that the Defence’s assertion that Mr Lum spoke in “one long string” without pauses and that Syed Abdul Rahman had no opportunity to seek clarification was unsupported by the evidence before the Court. In fact, the converse was true. The recordings of the conversations which were played in Court demonstrated that Mr Lum did not speak fast and that he had paused several times which would have allowed Syed Abdul Rahman to interject and ask his questions, if he had any. The only questions which Syed Abdul Rahman had, concerned the amount of money being paid out, and the date when the cheque needed to be collected. It was plain that he had understood Mr Lum perfectly well.

40     Next, the information provided by Mr Lum during the tele-conversations would have immediately alerted Syed Abdul Rahman to the fact that the issuance of the second cheque was premised on the belief that the first cheque was not “_presented to the bank”_ and so they will be cancelling the first cheque and issuing a new cheque. Syed Abdul Rahman made no attempt to contradict this belief or provide the information that he had in fact encashed the first cheque months ago. He remained silent on this matter and only spoke to ask how much was the amount in the second cheque and when he could collect it. I therefore disbelieved the Defence’s assertion that Syed Abdul Rahman did not know that the issuance of the second cheque was premised on a mistaken belief by Navigator.

#### (b)   Collection of the second cheque at Navigator’s office

41     On 10 October 2011, at about 2.10 pm, Syed Abdul Rahman collected the second cheque for the sum of $140,159.54 from Navigator’s office. This cheque was dated 6 October 2011. Syed Abdul Rahman signed the Acknowledgement of Collection form to acknowledge that he had collected both the withdrawal letter and the cheque. All three documents (the original Acknowledgement of Collection form and copies of the cheque and the withdrawal letter) were tendered in evidence. During his testimony, Syed Abdul Rahman stated that when he arrived at Navigator’s office, he had called My Lum who directed him to the information counter. There he was attended to by a lady. He signed the form and collected the cheque. He did not ask Mr Lum or the lady any questions. Later that same day, he opened a second estate account to deposit the cheque into the account. He withdrew $110,000 the following day and the remaining monies on 29 November 2011 before closing the account.

42     Syed Abdul Rahman stated in Court that he had previously been told by his brother that his brother had $360,000. This was the reason why he did not enquire further when Navigator issued the second cheque to him. He agreed that the total amount paid out by Navigator was about $280,000 which was less than the sum of $360,000 told to him by his brother. He did not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why he did not enquire about the remaining sum of about $80,000. He simply said that he had been told by the staff at Navigator that the price will fluctuate. He does not know anything about this investment and so he did not ask any questions.

43     It is puzzling why Syed Abdul Rahman did not seek any clarification if he did not understand his late brother’s investment portfolio with Navigator. He had several opportunities to do so. He had interacted with the staff from CPF Board, Navigator and DBS. Most importantly, he had solicitors who had acted for him in the probate matter. Yet, he had not asked anyone to explain to him why he had only received about $140,000 in April 2011 when his brother had informed him that he had more than two times that amount. He did not even question if it is possible for the price fluctuations to reduce the amount from $360,000 to less than half the sum, to only $140,000. He said that he was _willing to wait and to wait for someone to tell him what to do_.[^8] This ran counter to the clear evidence contained in the audio recordings. The recordings showed that Syed Abdul Rahman was not shy about asking for details and clarifications when he did not understand. When he could not hear clearly which organisation Mr Lum was from, he was quick to ask, “From where”. When he was unsure about the details, he had asked for more information. For example, he had enquired how much the cheque was for.

44     I therefore found it incredible that he would have made no attempt to enquire about a shortfall of up to $220,000 if he truly believed that his brother’s estate was worth $360,000. I also found that this bare assertion that his brother had informed him that he had $360,000 lacked credibility. It was only raised during Syed Abdul Rahman’s testimony in Court and was not referred to at any other time during the trial. Neither was it stated in either of his two statements given to the police. I therefore concluded that it was an after-thought, fabricated to conceal the fact that he had been wilfully blind to the fact that Navigator had issued the second cheque based on the mistaken belief that the first cheque had not been presented to the bank. A belief which Syed Abdul Rahman knew to be untrue. Syed Abdul Rahman himself had presented the first cheque and withdrawn the monies to fund his personal expenses and that of his family. This knowledge of Navigator’s mistake would also explain the alacrity with which Syed Abdul Rahman opened the second estate on the very same day that he had collected the cheque, and thereafter, he had withdrawn most of the money from the account, on the following day.

#### (c)   Probate papers and correspondence with Navigator

45     Syed Abdul Rahman had in his possession several documents which clearly showed the exact amount or the ballpark figure of the amount which he can expect to receive from his brother’s estate. The first set of documents were the Grant of the Letters of Administration with the Schedule of Assets attached which he had obtained in April 2011. The Schedule of Assets which listed the assets of the estate, quantified the net value of the estate to be $196,652.50. Specifically, it stated that the value of the AVIVA Insurance Investment Plan was $142,802.50. It is clear that the value of the AVIVA investment hovered at around $140,000 and not substantially more. In any event, the total value of the estate was computed to be far less than the $280,000 received by Syed Abdul Rahman from Navigator. The probate papers alone should have sounded alarm bells for Syed Abdul Rahman and alerted him that there was something odd about the amounts paid to him. He clearly chose to ignore all of them.

46     The policy documents would have been an additional source of information, to cue Syed Abdul Rahman that the value of his later brother’s investment was around S$140,000. The correspondence from Navigator pertaining to his late brother’s estate had consistently indicated that the value of his late brother’s AVIVA related asset was in the region of $140,000. The three key pieces of correspondence received from Navigator indicated that (i) Syed Abdul Rahman was entitled to only one payment, and (ii) that the value of his late brother’s asset was about $140,000.

47     The first correspondence is the AVIVA letter dated 3 January 2011, addressed to Syed Abdul Rahman which advised that the market valuation as at 30 November 2010 was S$142,802.50 and that there will be an ongoing quarterly fees payable until the fund withdrawal takes place. To effect the fund withdrawal, Syed Abdul Rahman was required to present the Grant of Letters of Administration once obtained, as well as the Withdrawal Instruction Form, duly completed. There is no mention that there will be more than one payment or that the monies will be paid in instalments.

48     The second correspondence is the AVIVA Withdrawal Letter accompanying the first cheque. The letter was dated 27 April 2011 and was sent to Syed Abdul Rahman. It was stated in the letter that a cheque for S$140,159.54 which was made payable to the estate of Syed Salleh bin Syed Mohsin, was enclosed with the letter. There was no mention of any further payments being due to the estate. It was also stated that if further assistance was required, the Customer Service Executives may be contacted, and their telephone number was provided.

49     The third correspondence was similar to the second. It was an AVIVA Withdrawal Letter dated 7 October 2011 which was handed to Syed Abdul Rahman together with the second cheque, when he visited Navigator’s office to collect the cheque on 10 October 2011. This letter specifically stated that the cheque (for the sum of S$140,159.54) was a replacement cheque issued for the full redemption of the CPFOA Investment Plan account. Again the contact particulars of the Customer Service Executives were provided for further assistance.

50     Placing all the documents together, the probate papers together with the correspondence from Navigator, what is seen is that Syed Abdul Rahman had been consistently informed that the value of his late brother’s investment asset with Navigator hovered around $140,000. It was never represented to him that the amount was anywhere close to $280,000 which was about the sum paid out by Navigator to him.

51     The probate papers together with the correspondence from Navigator, had consistently presented the figure of about $140,000 only. The Withdrawal Letter which accompanied the second cheque had stated that the second cheque was a replacement cheque which was issued for the full redemption of the investment account. Despite these clear statements, Syed Abdul Rahman claims that he believed that he was rightfully receiving a second disbursement of funds from his late brother’s investments with AVIVA. He made no attempt to seek clarification before presenting the second cheque to the bank. It is evident that Syed Abdul Rahman chose to ignore all the indications that the second cheque was paid in error. There was no basis for Syed Abdul Rahman’s belief that the estate was entitled to a second tranche of payment or that Navigator was paying out the monies in instalments.

#### Knowledge from wilful blindness

52     It is clear that Syed Abdul Rahman had acted with a dishonest intent when he converted the second cheque to his own use. Navigator, due to an internal error, had issued to him a second cheque for the exact same amount and termed it as a replacement cheque. If that alone did not alert him, then Mr Lum’s telephone call should have made it abundantly clear to him that Navigator was labouring under a misapprehension. Mr Lum had explained that he was calling because Navigator had ‘discovered’ that the first cheque had not been presented to the bank, which Syed Abdul Rahman knew to be untrue.

53     The weight of the evidence points to a single conclusion. That Syed Abdul Rahman actively knew or at the very least, had turned a blind eye to the fact that Navigator had made a mistake in believing that the first cheque had not been encashed. He ignored all the indicators and blinded himself to the obvious. Such wilful blindness points to active knowledge of the fact that Navigator was acting on a mistaken belief. Instead of correcting their mistaken belief, Syed Abdul Rahman proceeded to capitalise on that mistake.

54     The Appellate Court in _Wong Seng Kwan_ had discussed the implied obligation that one bears under the law to restore a lost item or property to its rightful owner. Steven Chong J held:

_Finders are not always keepers, and a finder who dishonestly keeps his find may instead “find” himself in violation of the law_._[^9]_

55     There is no doubt that Syed Abdul Rahman acted with dishonest intent when he turned a blind eye to the clear evidence that Navigator had issued the cheque in error. Instead of doing what he could to rectify that error, Syed Abdul Rahman quickly banked in the second cheque without alerting anyone to the fact that he had previously encashed a cheque for the same amount. Thus he caused wrongful loss to Navigator and concurrently, wrongful gain to himself.

#### Verdict

56     At the close of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence to establish every ingredient of the charge. I was satisfied that based on the witness accounts and the documents adduced, Syed Abdul Rahman had dishonestly misappropriated the second cheque belonging to Navigator for his own wrongful gain. I held that Prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and found Syed Abdul Rahman guilty and convicted him on the charge.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

57     The Prosecution informed the Court that Syed Abdul Rahman had several, criminal antecedents for property related offences and drug offences. His last conviction was in 2003 when he was convicted for an LT1 drug consumption offence and sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. He has had no further criminal convictions since.

58     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment and relied on a table of five sentencing precedents. The range of sentences in these cases was between 6 to 12 months’ imprisonment. The DPP pointed out that the general sentencing principle was that the higher the value of the property misappropriated, the longer the term of imprisonment. He added that all the accused persons in the cases listed in the table, save for _Public Prosecutor v Ho Man Yuk and others_, were first offenders who had pleaded guilty. He flagged out the case of _Public Prosecutor v Elly_ (MAC 9006165-2015) which was decided by a District Court. It was submitted that the factual matrix for that case was similar to that in the present case.

59     In that case, the accused person, a customer service manager, had converted to her own use, a sum of S$135,899.25, which had erroneously been transferred from her employer-company’s bank account to her savings account. She had withdrawn the money and spent it on her personal expenses. No restitution was made and no money was recovered. She was a first offender who had pleaded guilty. She was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment.

#### Mitigation plea and Defence’s submissions on sentence

60     The Defence Counsel submitted that Syed Abdul Rahman had played no part in causing the erroneous transfer. He had not actively caused the second cheque to be issued to him and so his culpability was correspondingly reduced. Similarly, the lack of restitution cannot be an aggravating factor in sentencing. When he was contacted by Navigator, there had been a change in his circumstances and the money had all been spent. He cannot therefore be held accountable for the lack of resolution.

61     The Defence Counsel added that Syed Abdul Rahman’s antecedents were old. He is now 59 years old and his age should be take into consideration when calibrating sentence. The Defence Counsel sought a sentence of six months’ imprisonment.

#### Sentencing considerations

62     The offence of criminal misappropriation under section 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years or with a fine or with both. It was generally accepted in this case, that given the gravity of the offence, a custodial sentence was warranted. I next considered whether there was any specific aggravating or mitigating factors which would have a bearing on the sentence.

63     I agreed with the Prosecution that the fact that Syed Abdul Rahman played no part in causing the erroneous issue of the second cheque by Navigator, transfer is at best, a neutral factor. It certainly does not have any mitigatory value. Syed Abdul Rahman had also claimed trial to the charge. Hence, he cannot avail himself of the customary sentencing discount granted for an early plea of guilt. I also noted that no monies were recovered and no restitution was made.

64     After giving due consideration to the all facts of this case, specifically to the amount of money which was misappropriated, I held that a term of 9 months’ imprisonment was appropriate. This sentence is also well within the range of sentences imposed in similar cases. Prosecution’s the table of Sentencing Precedents has reference. On the facts of this case, the sentence is neither manifestly excessive nor inadequate.
