CIVIL PROCEDURE – Costs – Principles – Taxation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 21/2020.\]

16 September 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff’s claim in the main suit, DC1633/2018 is for damages caused to his property (terrace house) arising from the reconstruction works carried out at the property adjourning his and that is owned by the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The alleged damages to the Plaintiff’s property were mainly damages caused by water seepage into the Plaintiff’s property as a result of the reconstruction works at the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ property.

2       The Plaintiff initially sued only the 1st and 2nd Defendants when the writ was filed on 7 June 2018. In their Defence, the 1st and 2nd Defendants denied that the damage to the Plaintiff’s property were caused by reconstruction works on their property. They further alleged that they had engaged the 3rd Defendant for addition and alteration works on a turnkey basis and that therefore, the 3rd Defendant was an independent contractor and that they were not liable for damages caused by the 3rd Defendant.

3       As a result of the averment of the 1st and 2nd Defendants, the Plaintiff then added the 3rd Defendant as a co-Defendant.

4       Therefore, the action against the 3rd Defendant is the result of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ defence on the basis that they are not liable for the acts of the 3rd Defendant which, the 1st and 2nd Defendants say, is an independent contractor.

5       In the course of the trial, it transpired that the 3rd Defendant was initially engaged as the builder for the reconstruction works. However, after the submission of the necessary paperwork to the Building Control Authority, before construction works began, the scope of works in the contractual arrangement between the 3rd Defendant and the 1st and 2nd Defendants was changed. The 3rd Defendant became involved only in the piling works and superstructure and substructure works. The rest of the reconstruction works, including the demolition of the old building, roofing, building and interior works, was carried out by or under the supervision of the 1st Defendant who himself is the owner and director of an interior design company called Elevated ID Pte Ltd.

## Procedural History

6       The main suit came for hearing before me on 11 February 2020, 16-17 March 2020 and 22-26 June 2020. On 26 June 2020, after the completion of the cross-examination of the 1st Defendant by counsel acting for the 3rd Defendant the day before, parties informed the Court that they were ready to enter into a consent interlocutory judgment, leaving the issue of damages to be determined via the process of assessment of damages. This procedure was adopted as it had transpired in the course of the trial that the Plaintiff had not filed his supporting evidence to substantiate his claim for the costs of rectification and repair works for the damage caused to his property. The hearing up to 26 June 2020 had been focussed on the issue of causation and on whether, all or which of the three Defendants are liable to pay damages to the Plaintiff.

7       The consent interlocutory judgment contained this term – “Costs and disbursements, payable by the 1st and 2nd Defendants to the 3rd Defendant, whether on a standard or indemnity basis, are to be determined by the Court and for such quantum to be thereafter to be agreed or taxed.” It was therefore agreed by all parties that the 3rd Defendant’s costs should be on a Sanderson order basis, that is, the 3rd Defendant’s costs are to be borne by the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

8       All parties have therefore agreed that the issue of whether the 3rd Defendant’s costs that are to be borne by the 1st and 2nd Defendants should be on the usual standard basis or on an indemnity basis is an issue that should be decided by the Court. As a result of this agreed term on the 3rd Defendant’s costs, I heard oral arguments on whether the Sanderson costs payable to the 3rd Defendant by the 1st and 2nd Defendants should be on a standard basis or on an indemnity basis, after recording the terms of settlement.

9       After hearing oral arguments and submissions by counsel for the 3rd Defendant and counsel for the 1st and 2nd Defendants, I rejected the 3rd Defendant’s submission that this was an appropriate case for costs to be on an indemnity basis and awarded costs to the 3rd Defendant on the usual standard basis. Unhappy with this outcome, the 3rd Defendant has filed its appeal against this court order.

10     Pursuant to the 3rd Defendant’s appeal on my order on costs, I now provide my grounds of decision.

## My Decision

11     The 3rd Defendant’s arguments that they are entitled to costs on an indemnity basis are as follows:

> (a)     The works undertaken by the 3rd Defendant were never on a turnkey basis.

> (b)     The 1st and 2nd Defendants knew that the 3rd Defendant was not contracted on a turnkey basis at all and therefore, their case against the 3rd Defendant was “built on nothing but a pack of lies” (as counsel for the 3rd Defendant put it).

> (c)     As a result of the foregoing, in causing the 3rd Defendant to be sued as a co-Defendant, the 1st and 2nd Defendants have acted in bad faith; their conduct of the proceedings was dishonest, abusive or improper; they had brought about wasteful or duplicative litigation; and the proceedings against the 3rd Defendant was an abuse of process.

The 3rd Defendant argued that on the foregoing bases, the 3rd Defendant is entitled to costs on an indemnity basis.

### The Law on Indemnity Costs

12     The starting point for a determination of whether indemnity costs is appropriate is Order 59 rule 5 (“O 59 r 5”) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332). O 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court laid down the factors that the Court may take into consideration in exercising its discretion in awarding costs, including relevant factors such as the conduct of all the parties and such conduct includes conduct before and during the proceedings[^1].

13     In _Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 167</span> (“_Airtrust_”), the High Court said the list in O 59 r 5 is not exhaustive. While O 59 r 5 requires the court to consider the stated factors therein, it is certainly free to take into account other circumstances of the case in determining whether there is a proper case to make an award of indemnity costs (_Airtrust_ \[19\]). At \[23\], the High Court laid down the broad categories of conduct by a party which may provide good reason for an order of indemnity costs to be made.

> 23    Without attempting to be prescriptive, there are, from my review of the case law, the following broad categories of conduct by a party which may provide good reason for an order of indemnity costs to be made:

>> (a)    where the action is brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes;

>> (b)    where the action is speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis;

>> (c)    where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper; and

>> (d)    where the action amounts to wasteful or duplicative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of process.

14     I will now examine the facts and evidence of this case to determine if the conduct of the 1st and 2nd Defendants has been shown to fall into any one or more of the categories laid down in _Airtrust_.

### Whether the 1st and 2nd Defendants caused the action to be brought against the 3rd Defendant in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes

15     With respect to the first category for indemnity costs to be awarded on the ground of bad faith or improper motive, the High Court in _Airtrust_ reviewed two cases in which the issue of indemnity costs was discussed – the case of _Amoco (UK) Exploration Company v British American Offshore Limited_ \[2002\] BLR 135 (“_Amoco_”) and the case of _Wong Meng Cheong v Ling Ai Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 549</span> (“_Wong Meng Cheong_”).

16     In its review of _Amoco_, the High Court in _Airtrust_ noted that in _Amoco_, Langley J had found that the plaintiff’s ulterior purpose in commencing the action was to put commercial pressure on the defendant to re-negotiate the commercial contract and that the action was therefore not founded on any genuine belief that the plaintiff had a case against the defendant. The fact that there was no genuine belief that the plaintiff had a case against the defendant was said to have been revealed by the fact that the plaintiff’s case was constantly changing, as it sought unsuccessfully to find a basis on which it could justify what it had done (see \[25\]).

17     In _Wong Meng Cheong_, Justice Lai Siu Chiu awarded indemnity costs against the unsuccessful plaintiffs who were two deputies seeking to set aside the transfer of property carried out by the deceased prior to his death. Justice Lai Siu Chiu made a finding that the plaintiffs’ purpose in commencing litigation was not because they wanted to protect the deceased’s interests but rather to increase their inheritance. Justice Lai Siu Chiu also found the costs of commencing the action by the plaintiffs to be entirely out of proportion to the amount of liquid funds available in the estate. The following facts were also taken into consideration in awarding indemnity costs (see _Airtrust_ at \[26\]):

> (a)     That the plaintiffs failed to provide their main expert witness with the necessary information to form a reliable opinion;

> (b)     The plaintiffs frequently prevaricated in the witness stand and argued with counsel during cross-examination; and

> (c)     Prior to the suit, the plaintiffs had threatened the first defendant with “seven years of litigation” and had expressed their desire to go through “four bruising rounds in court”.

18     Based on these findings, Justice Lai Siu Chiu had no difficulty in concluding that “the conduct of the entire action was, therefore, an exercise in oppressing the defendants” (see _Airtrust_ at \[26\]).

19     In the instant case, the Plaintiff first brought an action against the 1st and 2nd Defendants as owners of the adjoining property. The Plaintiff’s case against the 1st and 2nd Defendants is for breach of their duty of care to the Plaintiff when undertaking demolition and construction works to the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ property. The particulars of negligence pleaded against the 1st and 2nd Defendants included, amongst other things, the removal of aluminium capping to the metal roof edge without the permission or consent of the Plaintiff.

20     In their Defence, the 1st and 2nd Defendants denied liability and pleaded as follows: “The Defendants had engaged DTG & Co Pte Ltd (“DTG”) _(the 3rd Defendant)_ for addition and alteration works at the Defendants’ Home on a turnkey basis (“the Turnkey Project”). DTG was an independent contractor not under the employ of the Defendants. The Defendants also engaged Development Engineering Consultants (“DEC”) as the consultants for the Turnkey Project.”

21     Arising from this Defence of the 1st and 2nd Defendants, the Plaintiff then added the 3rd Defendant as a co-Defendant. The 1st and 2nd Defendants made two rounds of amendments to their Defence. In the latest version, the 1st and 2nd Defendants averred that, “(t)he 1st Defendant had, on a goodwill basis, engaged contractor(s) to perform rectification works on the Plaintiff’s Premises after being informed of alleged damage to the Plaintiff’s Premises. The 1st Defendant also informed the Plaintiff to show proof of the alleged damage allegedly caused by the demolition and construction works to the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ Home and to show proof that the alleged damage were allegedly caused by the said works to the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ Home.”

22     In short, the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ denial of liability vis-à-vis the Plaintiff is that there is no proof that the alleged damage to the Plaintiff’s property was caused by the demolition and construction works at the property of the 1st and 2nd Defendants. In the alternative, their case is also that the 3rd Defendant was involved as an independent contractor and they are not liable for the actions of the 3rd Defendant.

23     At the commencement of the trial, it was stated in the Opening Statement of the 1st and 2nd Defendants that the 3rd Defendant and/or the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ subcontractors were responsible for the following scope of works:-

> (a)     Earth works;

> (b)     Piling works;

> (c)     Sub- and superstructure works;

> (d)     Household shelter;

> (e)     Box culvert;

> (f)     Driveway;

> (g)     Drainage;

> (h)     Plumbing works;

> (i)     Anti-termite treatment;

> (j)     Pre-condition survey;

> (k)     Factory Licence with Ministry of Manpower;

> (l)     Insurance fees for the project and the application for the same;

> (m)     RTO fees;

> (n)     Noise monitoring;

> (o)     Disposal of bin;

> (p)     Mosquito control services;

> (q)     Project signboard;

> (r)     Supervisor for the renovation works;

> (s)     Scaffolding for the renovation works;

> (t)     Safety co-ordination for the renovation works;

> (u)     Safety measurement for the renovation works;

> (v)     Surveyor for the renovation works; and

> (w)     Hoarding for the works.

From the Opening Statement of the 1st and 2nd Defendants, it can be seen that at the commencement of the trial, it was not clear which parts of the works fell under the charge of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ sub-contractors and which parts of the works fell under the charge of the 3rd Defendant. The collective scope of works was lumped together as works that were done by the 3rd Defendant as well as the sub-contractors engaged by the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

24     At the trial, a lot of time was spent on cross-examining the 1st Defendant as regards which part of the work was carried out by whom. It was only at end of the cross-examination of the 1st Defendant by counsel for the Plaintiff that it became clear that the demolition and reconstruction work of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ property was split into three phases in chronological order: Phase 1 - Demolition work was done under the supervision of the 1st Defendant; Phase 2 - Piling, super structure and substructure works were down by the 3rd Defendant; and Phase 3 - Roofing works and interior design were done by the 1st Defendant or under his supervision. Thus, the evidence that came out from the trial is that the the 3rd Defendant was only responsible for Phase 2 (at the trial, the 3 phases were identified by counsel for the Plaintiff as A1, A2 and B).

25     Thus, it only transpired at the end of the cross-examination of the 1st Defendant by counsel for the Plaintiff that the scope of works undertaken by the 3rd Defendant was essentially just the piling works and the sub- and superstructure works and that overall, the rest of the reconstruction works were supervised by the 1st Defendant. Therefore, it became apparent that the 3rd Defendant did not undertake the reconstruction project on a turnkey basis and could not, under the circumstances, be considered as an independent contractor.

26     Through the extensive cross-examination of the expert witness, Mr Chin Cheong and that of the 1st Defendant, it also transpired that the failure to comply fully with the demolition plan as submitted and as approved by the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) was the main cause of the water seepage problems that contributed to the damage to the Plaintiff’s property. As the demolition works were done under the supervision of the 1st Defendant, it came to light that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are the parties that should be held responsible for the damage to the Plaintiff’s property.

27     In light of the evidence that became clear from the trial proceedings, all parties were then able to reach an agreement for the 1st and 2nd Defendants to take responsibility wholly without the need to proceed with the trial as against the 3rd Defendant. It was also on this basis that parties were able to reach an agreement for the 3rd Defendant’s costs to be borne by the 1st and 2nd Defendants (Sanderson costs order).

28     Whilst it did become clear from the evidence that surfaced in the course of the trial that the 1st and 2nd Defendants should be wholly liable to the Plaintiff, it is nonetheless important to point out that it is a fact that the matter was settled without any finding from the Court on the issue of whether the 3rd Defendant was or was not engaged as an independent contractor on a turnkey basis.

29     In cross-examination, when asked how the contractual arrangement with the 3rd Defendant could be said to be on a “turnkey basis”, the 1st Defendant had explained this thinking as follows - “_he is coming in as a main con because of his licence, obviously. So, there’s an insurance coverage that it take to the---undertake to cover everything even within my scope of work_”[^2].

30     From his testimony, it would appear that the 1st Defendant had perceived the 3rd Defendant to be the “main contractor” as the building plans were submitted to BCA using the builder licence of the 3rd Defendant. The 1st Defendant was also under the wrong impression that the 3rd Defendant’s insurance coverage for the project covered the whole project, including the parts done by or under his supervision as well. While it might be said that the 1st Defendant was misguided in thinking that the 3rd Defendant was the “main contractor” and was liable to the Plaintiff because of that, this misguided thinking alone can hardly be considered as evidence of bad faith.

31     Other than the 1st Defendant’s misguided thinking that the 3rd Defendant was the “main contractor” due to the 3rd Defendant being the builder on paper and due to the 3rd Defendant having bought full insurance coverage (as presumed by him), there is no other evidence of bad faith on the part of the 1st Defendant in pushing the blame to the 3rd Defendant.

32     I therefore do not find that the evidence shows that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had an ulterior motive in pushing the blame to the 3rd Defendant or that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had shown the kind of oppressive behaviour before the commencement of the trial as found in the cases of _Amoco_ and _Wong Meng Cheong_.

33     I therefore find that the 3rd Defendant has not shown that the 1st and 2nd Defendants acted in bad faith or with improper motive in causing the 3rd Defendant to be sued as a co-Defendant.

### Whether the action is speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis

34     Under this limb, the case reviewed by the High Court in _Airtrust_ is the case of _Tan Chin Yew Joseph v Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 274</span> (“_Tan Chin Yew_”). In _Tan Chin Yew_, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J agreed that “the plaintiff’s case was thin and ultimately irreconcilable with the contemporaneous documents and the law”. Nevertheless, the High Court found the plaintiff had no ulterior motive in bringing the proceedings and did not conduct his case in an oppressive or unreasonable manner or cause costs to be incurred irrationally or disproportionately. The High Court therefore did not find that the plaintiff’s conduct as a whole rose to the necessary level to make it appropriate for an award of indemnity costs against the plaintiff.

35     In this case, the only fact that the 3rd Defendant is relying on for its claim that it is entitled to indemnity costs is the fact that the 1st and 2nd Defendants knew that the 3rd Defendant was not an independent contractor all along and that therefore, in alleging that the 3rd Defendant was involved as an independent contractor on a turnkey basis, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had lied.

36     Again, while I agree that the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ claim that the 3rd Defendant was liable as an independent contractor is misconceived and unmeritorious, the 1st and 2nd Defendants still did not act in a manner that meets the level of unreasonableness that is required. The 1st and 2nd Defendants are entitled to rely on any applicable legal defences available to them. In the mind of the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant was the “main contractor” because he was the named builder for the project and had the insurance coverage for the whole project. While he had assumed wrongly, this by itself does not mean that the action of bringing in the 3rd Defendant was speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis.

37     In _Airtrust_, the High Court did not consider the plaintiff’s act of “consistently maintaining plainly unsustainable arguments despite contradictory evidence” to meet the threshold for indemnity costs.

38     Similarly, here, the 1st and 2nd Defendants had merely pursued a totally unmeritorious claim against the 3rd Defendant. But that is not enough. The 1st and 2nd Defendants’ act of shifting the blame to the 3rd Defendant should not be assessed on an ex post facto basis with the benefit of hindsight. As stated by the High Court in _Airtrust_, _“(a)s a baseline inquiry, it may be useful for a court to ask itself whether the party’s conduct was so unreasonable as to justify an award of indemnity costs. Such conduct must reflect a high degree of unreasonableness, and cannot merely be wrong or misguided in hindsight…_” (\[50\])

### Whether the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper

39     In _Airtrust_, the case of _Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 582</span> (“_Raffles Town Club_”) was reviewed for the award of indemnity costs under the ground of dishonest, abusive or improper conduct. The defendants in that case had argued that the action by the plaintiff consisted of speculative litigation and that the current directors and shareholders of the plaintiff had not acted bona fide because (a) the plaintiff’s claims were entirely inconsistent with its previous positions; (b) the plaintiff relied on documents which were inadmissible in law; and (c) it also adopted tactics that caused embarrassment to one of the defendants, such as the inclusion of criminal allegations in its statement of claim and the distribution of notes of evidence of the cross-examination of one of the defendants pertaining to his matrimonial proceedings which touched on his personal affairs.

40     In our case here, the 3rd Defendant has not pointed to any conduct of the 1st Defendant that shows dishonesty, other than that the 1st Defendant had no basis to claim that the contract with the 3rd Defendant was on a turnkey basis. The 1st and 2nd Defendants’ case against the 3rd Defendant might have been totally unmeritorious but there is no dishonesty. If the trial had proceeded to its completion, ultimately, the issue of whether the 3rd Defendant were engaged as an independent contractor on a turnkey basis is a question of fact to be decided based on the Court’s findings. On the facts of this case, this is not a question that had a clear and obvious answer at face value right from the beginning.

41     In the Opening Statement of the 1st and 2nd Defendants, it is clear that the 3rd Defendant was involved in the piling, superstructure and substructure works. It is also a fact that it was not clear in the expert’s evidence which comprised 3 technical reports what the cause of the water seepage problem was. Thus, it was not clear that the 3rd Defendant was not responsible at all right from the outset.

42     The 1st and 2nd Defendants’ case is also that they cannot be said to have any control over the 3rd Defendant and that the 3rd Defendant undertook the works with a significant degree of freedom, and were left to engage their own sub-contractors for the construction works under their charge. The cause of the water seepage which was found to be the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ failure to carry out the demolition works in accordance with the demolition plan only came out in the course of the trial. It was not something that was apparent to the 1st and 2nd Defendants from the outset.

43     I therefore find no basis to conclude that 1st and 2nd Defendants’ conduct in the course of proceedings was dishonest, abusive or improper.

### Whether the action amounts to wasteful or duplicative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of process

44     This ground is not relevant for our purposes as this case does not involve concurrent litigation.

### Whether there are good reasons that warrant the exercise of judicial discretion to award indemnity costs

45     The High Court in _Airtrust_ has emphasised that the 4 categories listed for the exercise of judicial discretion to award indemnity costs are not exhaustive. The categories are merely descriptive and non-exhaustive categories and should not be applied mechanically. At the end of the day, each case turns strictly on its own facts. In this connection, the High Court made three further observations. First, it is relevant to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the party’s conduct caused prejudice to the other party (\[51\]). However, this will only be considered as relevant after it has been determined that the losing party had acted unreasonably. As I have already answered this question in the negative, it is not necessary for me to consider what prejudice has been caused to the 3rd Defendant. The focus is on the unreasonableness of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ conduct; not on the prejudice caused to the 3rd Defendant.

46     The next observation made is that it is important for the court to bear in mind the context and nature of the dispute in ascertaining whether the case is of such an exceptional nature that it is appropriate to depart from the standard basis of costs. On this, this is a straightforward case of negligence arising from the reconstruction works that were carried out by or under the supervision of the 1st and 2nd Defendant for some parts and the 3rd Defendant for other parts. As the 3rd Defendant was involved in some parts of the reconstruction project, namely the piling, superstructure and substructure works, I do not agree that there is no relevance in bringing in the 3rd Defendant for the issue of causation at all.

47     In presenting oral arguments and submissions on behalf of the 3rd Defendant, counsel for the 3rd Defendant conceded that this is not a case where the 3rd Defendant should not have been involved at all, but rather, the 3rd Defendant ought have been brought in as a third party instead. While legally speaking, that may be the more appropriate approach or course of action for the 1st and 2nd Defendants to bring in the 3rd Defendant, I do not think this amounts to an act that is so unreasonable that costs should be awarded against the 1st and 2nd Defendants on an indemnity basis. On this aspect, I note that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are already paying the price of having to bear the costs of the 3rd Defendant on a Sanderson costs basis.

48     The third observation is that there may be situations where indemnity costs could be ordered despite the absence of unreasonable conduct. However, the High Court cautioned that such cases would be rare. It is important for the trial judge to consider if there are some compelling and exceptional reason for indemnity costs (see \[53\]).

49     The threshold for an order for costs to be paid on an indemnity basis is a very high one. I note that in spite of many allegations of impropriety in the conduct of the case in _Airtrust_, the court did not eventually award costs on an indemnity basis. Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Defendants urged me not to award costs on an ex post facto basis. I will quote the High Court in _Airtrust_ - “_It is easy in hindsight to say that it must have been obvious that there was no merit to the defendant’s arguments._”.

50     As similarly found in _Airtrust_ , the truth is that the trial involved very technical facts involving a number of expert reports. It was not until after the completion of the cross-examination of the 1st Defendant that the facts became clearer as to what could have caused the water seepage problems and which phase of the reconstruction project brought about the cause and which party was to be held responsible. Thus, in the absence of this trial process, it cannot be said that it was known from the outset that the 3rd Defendant is not liable at all.

51     As the 3rd Defendant was involved in the piling works and superstructure and substructure works, if hypothetically, the outcome at the conclusion of the trial is that the cause of the water seepage problems was attributed to works done by the 3rd Defendant, then the issue of whether the 3rd Defendant should be held liable as an independent contractor for that part of the reconstruction works is still relevant.

52     Therefore, the 3rd Defendant is a necessary party to the case. In the circumstances, I do not find any good reasons that warrant the exercise of my judicial discretion to award indemnity costs to the 3rd Defendant.

## Conclusion

53     As cautioned by the High Court in _Airtrust_, an order of costs on the indemnity basis is the exception rather than the norm and requires justification. In my view, it is all the more exceptional for costs on the indemnity basis to be ordered when there is no judgment or pronouncement after a full trial and where the issues have not been amply ventilated and adjudicated upon.

54     On the whole, the 3rd Defendant has not succeeded in persuading me that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had acted so unreasonably as to justify an order of indemnity costs. I do not find the alleged “lies” against the 3rd Defendant to have arisen out of malice or dishonesty. The arguments made by the 3rd Defendant are not sufficiently substantial to warrant a departure from the usual basis of costs.

55     I therefore order that the 3rd Defendants’ costs shall be borne by the 1st and 2nd Defendants on a standard basis.
