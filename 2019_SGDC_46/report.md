Civil Procedure – Amendment

7 March 2019

### Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan:

1       This was the plaintiff’s application under O 20 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) to disallow and therefore strike out the defence and counterclaim (“D&CC”) as amended supposedly pursuant to O 20 r 3(1), which provides:

**Amendment of pleadings without leave (O. 20, r. 3)**

**3.—(1**)    A party may, without the leave of the Court, amend any pleading of his once at any time before the pleadings are deemed to be closed and, where he does so, he must serve the amended pleading on the opposite party.

2       The facts are undisputed: the amended D&CC was filed electronically on 5 September 2018, accepted by the registrar on 11 September 2018, and served electronically on 12 September 2018. Disregarding these facts, pleadings would have been deemed closed on 10 September 2018.

3       As it turned out, this application was much ado about nothing.

4       The plaintiff took no issue with the merits of the amendments themselves, which in my judgment were mostly minor. The main question I had to answer was whether leave was required to amend the D&CC, and whether I would have given the defendant leave to amend the D&CC at the date the amendment was made (O 20 r 4(2)).

5       The plaintiff submitted that the D&CC had been amended without leave because O 20 r 3 required that an amended pleading be _served_ before pleadings were deemed closed, and that the defendant could have sought the plaintiff’s consent in writing. The defendant, in substance, argued that there were two parts to O 20 r 3(1). The first part required only the _amendment_ of the D&CC before close of pleadings. That was done on 5 September 2018. The second part provided only that the amended D&CC had to be served. That, too, was done. Although the amended D&CC was served later, O 20 r 3(1) did not expressly prescribe the time by which an amended pleading had to be served.

6       I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission. In my view, O 20 r 3(1) requires an amended pleading to be _served_ before pleadings are deemed closed. **_First_**, for each fresh pleading, the rules clearly prescribe the time by which it must be served:

**Service of statement of claim (O. 18, r. 1)**

**1**.    Unless the Court gives leave to the contrary or a statement of claim is endorsed on the writ, the plaintiff must **_serve_** a statement of claim on the defendant or, if there are 2 or more defendants, on each defendant, and must do so either _when_ the _writ is served_ on that defendant or _at any time after service of the writ but before the expiration of 14 days after that defendant enters an appearance_.

**Service of defence (O. 18, r. 2)**

**2.—(1**)    A defendant who enters an appearance in, and intends to defend, an action must, unless the Court gives leave to the contrary, **_serve_** a defence on the plaintiff _before the expiration of 14 days after the time limited for appearing or after the statement of claim is served on him, whichever is the later_.

…

**Service of reply and defence to counterclaim (O. 18, r. 3)**

**3.—(1**)    A plaintiff on whom a defendant serves a defence must **_serve_** a reply on that defendant if it is needed for compliance with Rule 8; and if no reply is served, Rule 14(1) will apply.

…

(4)    A reply to any defence must be **_served_** by the plaintiff _before the expiration of 14 days after the service on him of that defence_, and a defence to counterclaim must be **_served_** by the plaintiff _before the expiration of 14 days after the service on him of the counterclaim to which it relates._

**Pleadings subsequent to reply (O. 18, r. 4)**

**4**.    No pleading subsequent to a reply or a defence to counterclaim shall be **_served_** except with the leave of the Court.

…

This is also true of pleadings amended consequent to an amended pleading filed pursuant to O 20 r 3(1):

**Amendment of pleadings without leave (O. 20, r. 3)**

**3.**—…

(2)    Where an amended statement of claim is served on a defendant —

(a)    the defendant, if he has already served a defence on the plaintiff, may amend his defence; and

(b)    the period for **_service_** of his defence or amended defence, as the case may be, shall be _either the period fixed under these Rules for service of his defence or a period of 14 days after the amended statement of claim is served on him whichever expires later_.

(3)    Where an amended defence is served on the plaintiff by a defendant —

(a)    the plaintiff, if he has already served a reply on that defendant, may amend his reply; and

(b)    the period for **_service_** of his reply or amended reply, as the case may be, shall be _14 days after the amended defence is served on him_.

In my judgment, it would be strange to say that O 20 r 3(1) was not intended to provide a time limit by which an amended pleading could be served. **_Second_**, and relatedly, if the defendant was correct, then there would be the absurd result that an amended pleading could be served at any time. To say, as the defendant tried to persuade me, that the amended pleading must be served “immediately” or “without delay” or “within a reasonable time” would be to add to O 20 r 3(1) words that are not there.

7       As for when an amended pleading must be _filed_, O 18 r 21 simply provides that every pleading must be filed in the Registry. It does not prescribe when it must be filed. I need not decide whether a pleading must be filed by the time it must be served, since in this case the amended D&CC was filed on 5 September 2018, _ie_, before pleadings were deemed closed. My provisional view, however, is that it must. This seems to follow from my reading of O 20 r 3(1). Also, the sense in this interpretation is that this is the principal way by which the court is made aware of a step taken in the parties’ cases.

8       The defendant submitted that two problems would arise if the plaintiff’s reading of O 20 r 3 (and, presumably, my reading of O 18 r 21) were correct. First, a party would in substance have less time to amend pleadings than apparently allowed by the rules because he would have to make allowance for the lead-time required by the Court to process filings (in this regard, amended pleadings are different from fresh pleadings in that they are not automatically accepted by the electronic filing service). Second, to this extent, there would be uncertainty in the time allowed to file and serve an amended document.

9       In my view, these submissions are misconceived. The time of **_filing_** of a document does _not_ depend on when the document is processed or accepted by the registry. Instead, it is governed by what is popularly called the “first byte rule”, which provides that it is filed when the first part of the transmission is received in the computer system of the electronic filing service provider. In this regard, O 63A r 10(1) provides:

**Date of filing (O. 63A, r. 10)**

**10.—(1**)    Where a document is filed with, served on, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the Registrar using the electronic filing service and is subsequently accepted by the Registrar, it shall be deemed to be filed, served, delivered or conveyed —

(a)    where the document is filed, served, delivered or conveyed by electronic transmission from the computer system of the authorised user or registered user, **on the date and at the time that the** **_first part_** **of the transmission is received** in the computer system of the electronic filing service provider;

(b)    where the document is remotely composed on the computer system of the electronic filing service provider, **on the date and at the time that the** **_first part_** **of the transmission** containing instructions from the authorised user or registered user to so file, serve, deliver or convey the document **is received** in the computer system of the electronic filing service provider; and

(c)    where the document is filed, served, delivered or conveyed via a service bureau, **on the date and at the time that the** **_first part_** **of the transmission is received** in the computer system of the Registrar.

\[emphasis added in bold and bold italics\]

Likewise, the time of **_service_** need not depend on when the document is processed or accepted by the registry. The electronic filing service of course allows a party, out of administrative convenience, to serve the other party electronically (“e-serve”) with a document when the filing of that document is accepted by the registry. However, a party may also choose to e-serve that document immediately (_ie_, without waiting for the registry to process the filing), or serve that document by other means. If he chooses to e-serve the document when the filing has been accepted by the registry, then he must take the risk that service is delayed. In short, there is no necessary uncertainty that results from my interpretation.

10     For these reasons, the defendant did not comply with O 20 r 3(1) insofar as he served an amended D&CC after pleadings had been deemed closed.

11     In view of these matters, the dispute ultimately boils down to one of prejudice. In this regard, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that, had the D&CC been served by 10 September 2018, there would have been no ground for this application. The plaintiff also did not satisfy me that it suffered any prejudice as a result of having been served with the amended D&CC two days after that date, much less any prejudice not compensable by costs. In fact, the only prejudice alleged to have been suffered was the defendant’s very non-compliance with the Rules of Court, which “necessitated” this application. Neither was I impressed with the fact that the plaintiff filed this application without having tried to correspond with the defendant beforehand on, for example, waiving the irregularity as to the time of filing, the wasted costs as to the amendment, or by when an amended reply could be filed.

12     Accordingly, the only orders I made were that the amended D&CC stand good, and that the plaintiff have 14 days to file its amended reply and defence to counterclaim, with no order on costs of the application.
