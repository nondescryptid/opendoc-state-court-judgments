Sale of Immovable Property

16 June 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## DCA 17/2019

1       The Plaintiffs are Wah Lei Industrial Supply Co Pte Ltd (“Wah Lei”).

2       The Defendant is Nasrin Akter, a sole proprietor, trading as Good Luck Engineering Works (“Good Luck”). During the trial, the evidence of Good Luck was given by one Mohammad Hasan Miah, the Operations Manager of Good Luck.

3       The parties in this dispute agree on most of the material circumstances and workings of the various clauses in the contract between them, save for the interpretation of one clause which we shall term, for ease of reference, as Special Condition Clause 9 (“SC 9”).

4       The divergence of views as to how SC 9 is to be interpreted gave rise to the present action. Wah Lei claims that Good Luck is indebted to them for the sum of $195,000, GST thereon, amounting to $13,650, interest and costs. In the Counterclaim, Good Luck claims that it is Wah Lei which is indebted to her, in the sum of $7,720.87, interest and costs.

5       After carefully considering all the evidence, and the detailed Closing Submissions tendered by the respective solicitors, I found in favour of Wah Lei. I granted Judgment to Wah Lei for the sums of $195,000, the GST component of $13,650, interest at 5.33% from date of Writ to Judgment. Good Luck’s Counterclaim was dismissed. Wah Lei was to have the costs of the claim and counterclaim, to be taxed if not agreed. Good Luck appealed this decision.

6       Prior to the contract which gave rise to the current action, Wah Lei and Good Luck had entered into a “Tenancy Agreement” dated 19 May 2012 (“TA”). By this TA, Wah Lei, as “Landlord” agreed to let to Good Luck, as “Tenant”, premises at 23 Pioneer Road North #01-118 Singapore (the “Unit”). It was not in dispute that Wah Lei held the Unit themselves as a leaseholder from the holder of the reversionary interest of the Unit, this being the Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”). The relationship of “Landlord” and “Tenant” between Wah Lei and Good Luck was to be for a term of 2 years from 1 August 2012 till 31 July 2014.

7       We come now to the contract between Wah Lei and Good Luck which gave rise to the dispute. This was the “Sale and Purchase Agreement” dated 30 September 2012 (“S&P”). By the S&P, Wah Lei (as “Vendor”) agreed to “sell” to Good Luck, and Good Luck (as “Purchaser”) agreed to “buy” the Unit. (What was being sold and purchased here, would be the balance leasehold interest in the Unit.)

8       At about the time of the S&P, Wah Lei had a remainder of about 3 years of its lease from JTC. What was envisaged between Wah Lei and Good Luck was that the S&P was agreed on the basis that JTC would grant a further 10 years’ leasehold for the Unit to Good Luck at the expiry of the current lease.

9       The S&P was thus drafted to set out the understanding between Wah Lei and Good Luck as to Good Luck’s intentions for the Unit. The events that subsequently occurred revealed a difference in how the parties to the S&P understood SC 9 was to operate.

10     The S&P recited that Wah Lei agreed to sell and Good Luck agreed to purchase the Unit, at the “price of $310,000 which shall be paid in accordance with the Special Conditions herein”. Good Luck was also contractually bound to pay “the prevailing GST” on the sale price to Wah Lei “on completion”.

11     There was no dispute that the sale price for the Unit was the sum of $310,000 plus GST.

12     The $310,000 was to be paid by “instalments” pursuant to the following schedule:

> ·    The sum of $20,000, as deposit, on the execution of the S&P;

> ·    A sum of $50,000 on completion of the S&P;

> ·    A sum of $15,000 on the expiry of the 6th month from the date of completion;

> ·    A sum of $15,000 on the expiry of the 12th month from the date of completion; and

> ·    A sum of $15,000 on the expiry of the 18th month from the date of completion.

> ·    The balance of $195,000 to be paid pursuant to events as set out in the S&P.

13     It is not in dispute that the first 5 sums (as set out in the first 5 bullet points in paragraph 12 above) amounting to $115,000 have been paid. The balance $195,000 remains unpaid. Wah Lei claimed that they were entitled to be paid the balance sum of $195,000 (and GST thereon) without any deduction whatsoever. Good Luck did not deny that $195,000 was primarily payable, but countered that, by operation of SC 9, a larger sum was due to her from Wah Lei, thus reversing the situation (by way of set off) such that it was Wah Lei who owed her the aforesaid sum of $7,720.87.

14     Before we look carefully at the wording of SC 9, we should consider some of the material clauses in the S&P. The reading of these other clauses largely did not give rise to material differences between the parties.

15     Crucially, the sale of the Unit was obviously subject to JTC giving its written consent to the same. Both parties were obligated to submit to JTC the requisite application for JTC’s approval of the sale and purchase of the Unit.

16     Should JTC’s approval not be forthcoming within 10 weeks “from the date of acceptance of this Option (sic)” or “such further extension of time” agreed between parties, then “either party shall be liberty to terminate the sale and purchase” by written notice. In such eventuality, the Purchaser was to withdraw all caveats lodged and the Vendor was to refund all monies paid, free of interest. This consensual parting of ways was subject to “there being no default refusal neglect or failure on the part of the Vendor and/or the Purchaser” (in the application for JTC’s approval to the sale and purchase as aforesaid.

17     The other instances where parties may consensually “walk away” from the S&P would include the usual provisions relating to unsatisfactory replies to legal requisitions; and intended acquisition by the Government. These situations need no further discussion in the present case.

18     The mechanics as to how and when the final sum of $195,000 was to be paid are set out in clauses 6 to 9 in the Special Conditions to the S&P. We shall refer to them as SC 6 to SC 9 accordingly.

19     SC 6 provided that Good Luck “shall submit the necessary applications to JTC after completion herein to apply for an extension of a further ten years from the date of expiry of the existing lease. The application shall be submitted by (Good Luck) not later than six months from the date of completion, and (Good Luck) shall ensure that it takes all necessary steps in connection with the application, including any matter or condition which JTC may require”.

20     SC 7 provided that “(in) the event that JTC approves (Good Luck’s) application for the said extension, (Good Luck) shall pay a further sum of $195,000 to (Wah Lei) within fourteen (14) days of the approval by JTC”. It is not in dispute that this said sum of $195,000, described as “a further sum”, is the balance of the agreed sale price of $310,000.

21     SC 8 provided that “(in) the event that (Good Luck) fails to submit any application for the extension, or to take all necessary steps to submit a proper application for extension within six months from the date of completion, (Good Luck) shall pay the sum of $195,000 to (Wah Lei) within fourteen days after the expiry of six months from the date of completion. In the event that the application is rejected by JTC due to the (wilful) refusal or inability by (Good Luck) to comply with any reasonable term and condition imposed for the approval of the extension, the Vendor (sic) shall pay the sum of $195,000 to (Wah Lei) within fourteen days from the date of the rejection by JTC”.

22     We now come to SC 9, the respective readings and interpretations of which gave rise to this action.

23     SC 9 provided that “(in) the event that JTC charges a renewal fee for the renewal of the Lease and the renewal fee exceeds $30,000, (Wah Lei) shall reimburse (Good Luck) any sum exceeding $30,000 to (Good Luck). This may be deducted from the aforesaid sum of $195,000 payable by (Good Luck) to (Wah Lei) under 8 above. The renewal fee will not include any investment criteria, rent, whether annual or otherwise, and will apply only where such fees are stated by JTC to be renewal fees.”

24     The reference in SC 9, to “the aforesaid sum of $195,000 payable by (Good Luck) to (Wah Lei) under 8 above” appears to refer to SC 8. But this reference appears to be erroneous, as payment under SC 8 would only be in cases where Good Luck failed to submit any application (or a proper application) for a Lease extension, or where JTC rejects the application of Good Luck due to Good Luck’s wilful refusal or inability to comply with a reasonable term or condition imposed by JTC. In such instances, there would not be the incurring of “renewal fees” as such. The reference was probably intended to refer to payment under SC 7 instead.

25     As it transpired, the application for an extension of the Lease was made by Good Luck. JTC, by their letter dated 10 December 2015 (“JTC’s Offer”) offered a “further term of lease” of 10 years and 16 days from 16 December 2015.

26     JTC’s offer for this “further term of lease” of slightly longer than the envisaged 10 years (for ease of reference and convenience, we shall further refer to this “further term of lease” as the “10-year extension”), was contingent on Good Luck’s agreeing to pay a “Building Premium” of $217,496.14 (plus GST of $15,224.73 giving a total of $232,720.87).

27     JTC’s Offer also set out that further monthly sums were to be payable by Good Luck during the term of the 10-year extension. These were a “land rent” (also referred to as “annual rent”) amounting to $225.36 (plus GST at $15.78) per month, and a “service charge” (which is also described as “by way of additional and further rent”) amounting to $159.08 (plus GST at $11.14) per month. It is not in dispute that Good Luck had been charged by JTC for these sums of “land rent” and “service charge” plus GST thereon, amounting to $411.36 per month.

28     Other sums Good Luck was liable to pay, as set out in JTC’s Offer were the sums of $95 (plus GST of $6.65) as “Cost for preparation of Agreement for Lease”, and $150 (plus GST of $10.50) as “Cost for preparation of Lease”.

29     This is where the seeds of dispute were sown. Wah Lei considered the “Building Premium” sum of $232,720.87 (inclusive of GST) to be a sum that Good Luck had to pay JTC for the 10-year extension, and was not what parties envisaged as being a “renewal fee”. Thus, once Good Luck successfully obtained the 10-year extension, the sum of $195,000 (plus GST) was payable to them (Wah Lei) by Good Luck. Good Luck thought otherwise.

30     Good Luck read SC 9 to mean that the sum of $195,000 (termed by JTC as a “Building Premium”) was the “renewal fee” envisaged by SC 9. Hence, Good Luck calculated what they said was due from Wah Lei as follows. As SC 9 provided that Good Luck would be liable for the first $30,000 of the renewal fee, Wah Lei would be responsible for footing the balance of the $232,720.87 (inclusive of GST) charged by JTC as “Building Premium”. Hence the first part of Good Luck’s calculation went thus: Wah Lei would therefore be liable (to Good Luck and by virtue of SC 9) for $232,720.87 minus $30,000: a sum of $202,720.87. Then, as Good Luck had to pay Wah Lei the balance sum as provided by the S&P (the sum of $195,000), the final account would be $202,720.87 minus $195,000, giving the sum of $7,720.87 still due to Good Luck from Wah Lei, and hence the basis of the Counterclaim. The Solicitors for Wah Lei point out that in any event, this second part of the calculation by Good Luck is erroneous, as Good Luck also had to pay Wah Lei the GST on the said $195,000. The GST sum amounted to $13,650.

31     My finding was that SC 9 was clear enough to support the stand taken by Wah Lei. The position taken by Good Luck was clearly unsustainable by the plain meaning of the words in SC 9. Although I would just pause sufficiently to say that had SC 9 been drafted with a bit more detail and particularity, this litigation may not even have occurred. The main dispute arose round the meaning of “renewal fee”. Whilst SC 9 did provide for exclusions as to what would constitute a “renewal fee”, a clearer definition would have been more practical and useful.

32     At trial, Wah Lei sought to argue that a “renewal fee” would be akin to an “administrative” or “handling” fee. Good Luck sought to argue that “renewal fee” would refer to the sum that JTC charged for the renewal of the Lease (that is, the granting of the 10-year extension), and this would be the Building Premium.

33     SC 9 begins with the words “In the event that JTC charges a renewal fee for the renewal of the Lease …”. This, it could be argued, suggested that parties envisaged that JTC may not even impose any “fee” specifically with respect to the renewal of the Lease. Coupled with the apparent cap of $30,000 again suggested that parties had not envisaged that the Building Premium was to be considered as a “renewal fee”. I would not, however, say that this is the strongest argument to support Wah Lei’s stand. The more cogent reasons for coming to the conclusion that Wah Lei’s contention should be upheld, are set out in the paragraphs that follow.

34     First, we consider that the parties chose to describe the sum to be taken into consideration as a “fee” (as in “renewal fee”). This appears to support Wah Lei’s construction, that the renewal fee would be some form of administrative charge that JTC would impose (and charge Good Luck) for agreeing to, and executing the extension of the Lease.

35     Second, JTC describes the sum of $232,720.87 (inclusive of GST) as a “Building Premium”. This clearly referred to the price that Good Luck had to pay to enter into a fresh Lease with JTC. Good Luck would be “purchasing” a 10-year leasehold in the Unit. It could be argued that this “Building Premium” represented the accelerated and lump-sum rent that Good Luck would (as Tenant to JTC) be liable to pay for the 10-year leasehold term. The exclusion of “rent” (as a component of “renewal fee”) does further qualify the definition as “rent, whether annual or otherwise”. Therefore, the Building Premium could be said to be the “rent” that JTC could otherwise have collected, periodically, but in an accelerated form. It might then be argued to the contrary that “rent” connotes a periodic payment. To counter this, it would be added, in support of Wah Lei’s stand, that that would take the meaning of the “Building Premium” even further away from the meaning of a “fee”. I would agree with Wah Lei’s contention that a “fee” would refer more to the consideration for the provision of a service, in this case, JTC’s (administrative) acts of granting the extension of the Lease to Good Luck. The Building Premium, being the full consideration for a substantive interest in land (in this case, a leasehold in commercial premises for a 10-year term) is more in the nature of the price for an interest in land, rather than a “fee” as such. Upholding Good Luck’s contention would have meant that Wah Lei would be paying almost in full (save for the first $30,000) the sum that Good Luck had to pay JTC for a substantial interest in land.

36     The qualifier in the later part of the final sentence of SC 9 seals the issue in favour of Wah Lei’s stand. This part reads, “… and will apply only where such fees are stated by JTC to be renewal fees.” JTC did not refer to the Building Premium as a “renewal fee” anywhere. On a plain reading of SC 9, there had to be this positive position taken by JTC for Good Luck’s contention to succeed. Both parties had argued that the other had the burden of proving the position in its favour. Good Luck took the position that Wah Lei had to call a representative from JTC to give evidence that JTC did not regard the Building Premium as a “renewal fee”. Wah Lei took the opposite position, of course, that it was Good Luck who had the burden of proving that JTC took the position that the Building Premium was a “renewal fee”.

37     I agreed with Wah Lei on this point. The primary responsibility that kicked in upon a successful obtaining of the 10-year extension, was for Good Luck to pay Wah Lei the balance $195,000 plus GST. If Good Luck claimed that this $195,000 (plus GST) was not the sum due to Wah Lei, they had the burden of proving so, and to show an entitlement of a set off. In any event, the starting point at trial was that JTC had never referred, or stated that the Building Premium was a “renewal fee”. That being the starting point, the burden of proving that point in its favour fell squarely on Good Luck. This burden not having been discharged, we have the confirmed position that JTC had never, at any point in time, stated that the Building Premium was indeed a “renewal fee”.

38     For these reasons, I found in favour of Wah Lei and granted judgment for Wah Lei as aforesaid.
