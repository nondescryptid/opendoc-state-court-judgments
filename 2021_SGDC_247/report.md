2       Another charge under s 352 of the PC was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentencing, I sentenced the Accused to a term of 10 years preventive detention (“PD”), backdated to the date of his arrest on 14 November 2019.

4       The Accused is now appealing against this sentence, which he is currently serving.

## Statement of Facts

5       The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

##### Facts pertaining to DAC 904281-2020

6       On 13 November 2019 at about 9.46 p.m., one Musaruddin Bin Yatim (the victim) was sitting outside Room 4022 located at Level 4 of Angsana Home (“the Home”). At about the same time, the Accused came up to Level 4 as that was where his room was located.

7       As the Accused was walking towards the victim, the victim could smell alcohol on the Accused, and observed that the Accused was walking unsteadily.

8       The Accused moved towards the victim and punched him three times with his right hand. The first punch was to the victim’s left cheek, the second to the victim’s mouth, and the third to the victim’s right eye. As a result of the punches, the victim was unable to open his right eye as it was swollen. The first victim also felt pain and sensed that his teeth had been knocked out. The victim did not retaliate at any point.

9       The victim was subsequently conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital. His right eye could not be examined in detail initially due to significant swelling, and he was admitted for observation overnight. He was later found to have suffered broken teeth, fracture of the maxillary alveolar bone and swelling over the right eye with no acute damage to vision. The victim was hospitalised for two days.

10     The Accused claimed that he had consumed one tall can of Barron’s beer prior to the incident.

##### Facts pertaining to DAC 932019-2019 and DAC 904280-2020

11     After a police report was lodged at 9.46 p.m. concerning the incident above, Police Staff Sergeant Tan Ming Wei Lionel (“SSgt Lionel”) and one Police Sergeant (2) Joel Lim (“Sgt Joel”) were despatched to the Home. At about 10.02 p.m., they arrived at the Home.

12     Upon proceeding to Level 4, they saw the Accused sleeping on his bed. The Accused was woken up for questioning. He appeared drunk and began shouting and gesturing aggressively. A decision was made to place the Accused under arrest and he was escorted to the police patrol car accordingly. The Accused was uncooperative and shouting along the way.

13     The Accused informed SSgt Lionel that if he were to be handcuffed, he would turn violent and refuse to cooperate with the police. SSgt Lionel then asked for back up. At about 11.30 p.m., Police Sergeant (3) Waris Ahmad Bin Salbir Ahmad (“Sgt Waris”) and a colleague arrived in response to SSgt Lionel’s request. The Accused was handcuffed, and he continued resisting and shouting at the police officers.

14     The Accused was subsequently placed inside the patrol car. He was seated in the middle rear seat, in between Sgt Joel and Sgt Waris. The Accused continued his aggressive behaviour inside the car. SSgt Lionel was the driver and proceeded to drive off when the Accused used his left leg to kick SSgt Lionel on the back of his head. SSgt Lionel immediately felt pain on the rear left side of his head, as well as pain and soreness on his left shoulder.

15     Upon arriving at the Regional Lock Up at Woodlands Division on 14 November 2019 at about 12.10 a.m., the Accused remained aggressive and continued shouting and struggling. He then used his right leg to kick Sgt Waris on his left leg, resulting in Sgt Waris feeling pain on his left leg.

16     As a result of the Accused’s actions, SSgt Lionel suffered a stable head injury and neck strain and was given one day of medical leave. Sgt Waris suffered a left knee contusion and was given one day of medical leave.

## Antecedents

17     The Accused was heavily traced.

## The first PD Report

18     The Prosecution urged the court to call for a pre-sentencing report to assess the Accused’s suitability for PD, under s 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”). There was no objection from counsel for the Accused at this stage, and in view of the Accused’s antecedents, I proceeded to call for the report accordingly.

19     In the first PD report dated 4 September 2020 (marked PD1), psychologist Mr Cheng Xiang Long (“Mr Cheng”) assessed that the Accused’s general risk of reoffending was high, and his risk for violence re-offending in particular, was also high.

20     The Accused took issue with some of the contents in PD1, and Mr Cheng was invited to give a written response to these objections. His letter to the court dated 3 November 2020 was marked PD2. As the Accused still took issue with both PD1 and PD2, I then allowed his application to call Mr Cheng to the stand for him to be questioned on certain aspects of his report.

21     A summary of the findings made by Mr Cheng in PD1 and PD2 are set out below:

> (a)     Mr Cheng found that the Accused was not forthcoming during his interview with him, and frequently cited his poor memory as a reason for not being able to respond. As such, the Accused provided very little information on his criminal and family history and some of this historical information had to be gathered by Mr Cheng from an old pre-sentencing report completed in 2004. In particular, when the Accused was asked about his robbery antecedent in 2004, his response was “_I have never robbed anyone_”.

> (b)     Mr Cheng found that the Accused engaged in a pattern of blaming his offences on his intoxication and non-compliance with psychiatric medication. For his current charges, the Accused claimed that he was not aware of his actions as he had “blacked out” due to the influence of alcohol and his stopping of medication. While the Accused acknowledged that his actions (in committing the offences) were wrong, he did not explicitly acknowledge or assume responsibility for his actions preceding the offences i.e. decision to stop taking his medication or consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication. In this manner, Mr Cheng found that the Accused failed to assume responsibility over his actions.

> (c)     The Accused’s alcohol use was assessed to be linked to his risk for violent re-offending.

> (d)     Mr Cheng found that the Accused presented with a pattern of non-compliance to his psychiatric medication, which was linked to his violent offending. The Accused reported that he had stopped consuming medication for about three weeks prior to the current offences, as he disliked the side effects of the medication.

> (e)     Mr Cheng assessed the Accused to belong to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release, and his risk of violence re-offending was in the “High” range.

> (f)     The Accused did not present with any significant protective factors for his risk of violent re-offending.

> (g)     The Accused’s high risk of violent re-offending was assessed based on his prior history of offences against public servants, his continued alcohol use habit despite his insight that his alcohol use had led to his past offences, his non-compliance to medication in the weeks prior to the current offences, and his failure to assume responsibility over his actions for his offences and those preceding his offences.

22     In court, Mr Cheng maintained his position in PD1 and PD2, further explaining that his assessment that the Accused was not forthcoming was also based on his own observation of the Accused’s behaviour during the interview.[^1]

23     When questioned about his view that the Accused had not assumed responsibility for his actions, Mr Cheng explained that this was on the basis that the Accused _knew_ that his consumption of alcohol and stopping of medication was linked to his past offending behaviour, and yet he still continued to consume alcohol and stop his medication.[^2]

24     Mr Cheng agreed with Defence counsel that the Accused’s stay at the Home in the last few years had “helped to stabilise him a little bit”[^3], and the Accused’s use of alcohol had decreased in frequency, but pointed out that despite this, the Accused was still not able to stay away from re-offending within a period of two years.[^4] Mr Cheng further stated that the Accused had not demonstrated any concrete or specific plans to stop his alcohol consumption, or to deal with high risk situations or triggers.[^5]

## The Accused’s evidence

25     The Accused chose to give evidence in court as well, explaining that he only left the Home about once or twice a month[^6], and those were the only occasions when he could drink alcohol. He also explained that when Mr Cheng had asked him during the interview whether he had robbed anyone, he had said he did not rob anyone because that was not in his present set of charges. He claimed that Mr Cheng had not specifically asked him about his conviction in 2004[^7].

26     When asked by the Prosecution whether he was able to recall why he committed the present offences, the Accused stated that he did not remember exactly but “the person at the home would keep disturbing \[him\]” and the person “would wear slippers into the prayer area, that is why”. He also claimed that he only hit the victim lightly, but perhaps because the victim was old, that was why his jaw was fractured.[^8]

## The Accused’s medical report

27     Before the Accused could be sentenced, a medical report dated 21 July 2021 from Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) was tendered by Defence counsel, revealing that the Accused had been admitted to CGH on 29 Jan 2021 because of an incidental finding of a large mass present in the upper pole of the right kidney, following an ultrasound done for an unrelated hepatitis C condition. The tumour had a 80% to 90% chance of malignancy, and surgery (laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy) was conducted. A review was conducted on 12 April 2021 and the Accused was functionally well. It was explained to him that he had stage 3 right kidney cancer which was completely removed. It was further stated that the 5-year survival rate at this stage of the disease ranged from 60% to 70% and the Accused would require close clinical and radiological surveillance.

## The second PD report

28     Following this, the Prosecution requested that the Accused be re-assessed for his suitability for a PD sentence, and a second pre-sentencing report dated 13 September 2021 was subsequently tendered to court and marked PD3.

29     In PD3, the Accused was still found to be suitable for the PD regime, and of generally good physical condition in spite of his underlying medical conditions. Mr Cheng interviewed the Accused again, and maintained his assessment that the Accused’s general risk of reoffending was high, and his risk for violence re-offending in particular, was also high. The Accused’s score continued to place him in the group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release.

30     Compared to his interview for PD1, Mr Cheng assessed that the Accused was “relatively forthcoming” and largely able to share details for most of his past offending behaviours. Mr Cheng further noted that the Accused had recently re-connected with his mother and siblings (whom he had lost contact with since 2004) when his sister paid him a tele-visit in 2021 upon coming to learn about his medical condition. His sister had also expressed her desire for the Accused to stay with her in the future so that she could support his reintegration.

31     The rest of the contents of PD3 were unremarkable and largely similar to PD1 and PD2. The Accused continued to present with a pattern of justification regarding his violent offences. He denied being a violent individual, and shared that most of his actions were in retaliation to perceived threats or provocations. He also appeared to minimise his past violence offences. While the Accused took responsibility over his offences and presented with insight that his alcohol use and non-compliance to psychiatric medication may have resulted in his state of agitation, Mr Cheng noted that his insight had not translated to concrete actions in the past to avoid alcohol use and to comply with medication.

32     Nevertheless, Mr Cheng did note that there were some protective factors present. The Accused had expressed a motivation to stop his alcohol use and offending behaviours following his recent medical issues, and expressed a willingness to seek assistance from the National Addictions Management Services (“NAMS”) at IMH to address his alcohol use and to comply with his psychiatric medication in the future. In addition, the presence of familial social support in the form of his elder sister and her family could also mitigate his risk for violent re-offending.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

33     The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of PD of at least 10 years was appropriate in the present case.

34     Referring to the framework set out in _Sim Yeow Kee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 209</span> (“_Sim Yeow Kee_”), the Prosecution pointed out that (1) the technical requirements under s 304(2)(a) of the CPC were satisfied in the present case, and (2) it was expedient to sentence the Accused to PD as the protection of the public was the paramount sentencing consideration.

35     In making its case with regard to the second requirement of expediency, the Prosecution pointed out that:

> (a)     The circumstances of the offences in the present case showed that the Accused posed a danger to members of the public. In particular, the attack on the victim was unprovoked and senseless, where the Accused had targeted a sensitive region of the victim’s body i.e. the face. The victim suffered from serious injuries, including broken teeth, a fracture of the maxillary alveolar bone, and swelling over the right eye. The Accused had also assaulted two police officers; and

> (b)     The Accused’s long list of antecedents demonstrated that he was beyond reformation.

36     The Prosecution also relied on the contents of the PD reports to support the above.

37     With regard to the Accused’s medical condition, the Prosecution’s position was that the present case did not warrant the exercise of judicial mercy as (1) the Accused was not suffering from a terminal illness, and (2) there was no evidence that the Accused was so ill that a sentence of imprisonment would carry a high risk of endangering his life. (See _Chew Soo Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> (“_Chew Soo Chun_”) at \[22\]). Additionally, the Prosecution pointed out that there was a strong countervailing public interest against exercising judicial mercy in the present case, as the risk of violent re-offending on the part of the Accused was high.

38     In relation to the issue of whether some mitigating weight could nonetheless be given to the Accused’s medical condition, the Prosecution’s position was that this was irrelevant to sentencing, as (1) the Accused’s ill health did not have a direct bearing on his culpability, and (2) there was no evidence that a lengthy term of imprisonment would have a disproportionate impact on the Accused or cause a significant deterioration in his health or significantly exacerbate any pain or suffering. In fact, the Prosecution pointed out that the Accused had received treatment while he had been in remand, as a result of which he was now in stable condition.

39     In suggesting a term of at least 10 years PD, the Prosecution relied on the following sentencing precedents:

> (a)      _PP v Tang Hian Leng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 180</span>, where the offender was convicted for offences under s 323, s 408 and s 419 of the PC, and s 6(1)(a) read with s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A), and found to belong to the group of prisoners with a 43.8% probability of recidivism within two years of release. His risk of violence was assessed to be moderate, and there were several protective factors such as the offender having made positive changes since his last incarceration (e.g. obtaining employment, stopping drug use etc), and finding a partner who engaged in pro-social conventional activities with him. He had previously been sentenced to a term of 12 years PD. On this occasion, he was sentenced to a term of seven years PD.

> (b)      _PP v Johari Bin Mohd (SC-900518-2017)_, where the offender was convicted for offences under s 332, s 353, s 380 and s 379 of the PC, and found to belong to the group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. His risk of violence was found to be moderate, and he presented with no protective factors. He had previously been sentenced to a term of eight years corrective training. On this occasion, he was sentenced to a term of nine years PD.

40     The Prosecution pointed out that the above two precedents involved offenders whose risk of violence were only found to be moderate, as opposed to the Accused, whose risk was found to be high. As such, the present case warranted the imposition of a longer term of PD.

## Mitigation

41     In mitigation, Defence counsel argued that it was _not_ expedient to sentence the Accused to a term of PD, and suggested instead a global sentence of three years and one month imprisonment.

42     In particular, counsel made the following points in dispute of certain findings made in the PD reports:

> (a)     The Accused was forthcoming - The finding made by Mr Cheng in PD1 was that the Accused had not been forthcoming during the assessment interview. Counsel refuted this, and explained that there had been communication issues between the Accused and Mr Cheng. In addition, the Accused had not been able to recall certain information, and Mr Cheng had conflated this with the Accused deliberately withholding information. In fact, in his second assessment interview for PD3, Mr Cheng found that the Accused was “relatively forthcoming”. Therefore, it was not true that the Accused had not been forthcoming, and this was therefore not a risk factor that should be taken into account.

> (b)     The Accused had assumed responsibility for his offences - Counsel asserted that the Accused never denied committing the offences, nor did he try to minimise his responsibility. The Accused had also not blamed the victims for his violence or tried to justify his violent actions. In PD3, Mr Cheng appeared to accept that the Accused “took responsibility over his offences” and “presented with insight that his alcohol use and non-compliance to psychiatric medication may have resulted in his state of agitation”.

> (c)     PD1 had incorrectly reported the extent of the Accused’s alcohol use – In PD1, it was recorded by Mr Cheng that the Accused was consuming beer on a daily basis and would regularly consume up to six cans of beer. This was factually inaccurate, as the Accused could only consume alcohol when he left the Home once or twice a month. While PD3 appeared to correct that by stating that the Accused would only consume beer or Chinese wine when he was allowed to leave the Home, it did not address the issue of whether this change in frequency and amount of alcohol consumption affected the Accused’s risk of recidivism.

> (d)     The Accused is now capable of consequential thinking and knows that his actions of stopping his medication can seriously increase his risks of re-offending.

43     Counsel also pointed out that while there had been no protective factors identified in PD1, several were found in PD3, including:

> (a)     The Accused was motivated to stop his alcohol use and offending behaviours following his recent medical issues;

> (b)     The Accused expressed a willingness to seek assistance from NAMS to address his alcohol use;

> (c)     The Accused expressed a willingness to comply with his psychiatric medication in the future; and

> (d)     The Accused had reconnected with his family, who have expressed a desire to care for him.

44     Given the different findings made between PD1 and PD3, counsel argued that the Accused’s risk of recidivism should not remain the same.

45     In addition, counsel also pointed out that the Accused’s antecedent records showed that he has been increasingly able to spend time in the community before re-offending. In particular, after the Accused’s release from his previous sentence of PD, there was a general decrease in the nature and frequency of his offending.

46     With regard to the Accused’s medical condition, counsel acknowledged that it would not warrant the exercise of judicial mercy as set out in _Chew Soo Chun_, but argued that it was still serious enough to be treated as a factor mitigating against the imposition of a sentence of PD. This was because a sentence of PD would have a disproportionate impact on the Accused, given that:

> (a)     The minimum term for a sentence of PD is seven years; and

> (b)     There is a 30 – 40% chance that the Accused may not survive in the next five years, as indicated in the medical report.

48     In relation to the offences under s 332 of the PC, counsel relied on the sentencing framework set out in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”) and submitted that the present case fell within Band 1 (with a sentencing range of a fine or up to one year imprisonment), as there were minor injuries caused. Citing sentencing precedents which showed a range of sentences from nine weeks to three months, counsel suggested that an appropriate sentence in the present case, having taken into account the Accused’s antecedents, was four months imprisonment.

49     In relation to the offence under s 325 of the PC, counsel referred to _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> (“_BDB_”), and noted that the injuries in the present case were less serious than those in _BDB_, and that a term of two years and nine months’ imprisonment would be adequate, bearing in mind the Accused’s antecedents. Counsel also referred to the cases of _PP v James Daniel Rhodes_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 140</span>, and _PP v Wong Tuan Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 248</span>, where sentences of 18 months’ imprisonment and 13 months’ imprisonment respectively were imposed for charges under s 325 of the PC.

50     Counsel also submitted that in the event that PD was deemed to be appropriate for the Accused, this should be set at the minimum term of seven years, given the Accused’s age, medical condition and the fact that he would likely be continuing to reside at the Home upon his release, or residing with his sister, where there would be a structured environment.

51     Finally, counsel noted that the Accused was deeply remorseful for his actions and accepted full responsibility for what he did. He was also truly motivated to stop consuming alcohol and to adhere to his medication.

## Court’s decision

52     There was no dispute that the Accused satisfied the technical requirements for the imposition of a sentence of PD under s 304(2)(a) of the CPC. The only question was therefore whether the court was satisfied that it was “expedient for the protection of the public” that he should be so sentenced. Having considered all the information placed before me, I answered the question in the affirmative.

### The findings in both PD reports were sound

53     I considered the contents of both PD reports as well as Mr Cheng’s evidence in court. I was satisfied that the findings made in the reports were sound, and relied on them accordingly.

54     The first objection raised by counsel was in respect of Mr Cheng’s remark in PD1 that the Accused was “not forthcoming during the interview” and provided very little information on his criminal history and family history. Counsel argued that this conclusion was erroneous, as there were communication difficulties, and it was the Accused’s case that he had genuinely forgotten the details of his criminal offending. I was willing to accept that the Accused might well have laboured under a memory failure when trying to give details of his past offending. Given the multiple times he had been in our court system, it was not surprising at all that he might not be able to recount all his previous offences. This was, however, neither here nor there. I did not understand Mr Cheng to have relied on the Accused not being forthcoming as a significant risk factor in his assessment.

55     Another objection was made with regard to the findings in PD1 on the Accused’s alcohol consumption, as the Accused could not have regularly drunk six cans of beer at the material time when he was living in the Home and did not have the means to purchase that amount of beer. The Accused was also only able to leave the home twice a month. I accepted that it was unlikely he could consume six cans of beer daily. In this aspect, there could have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding between Mr Cheng and the Accused. However, this did not detract from the finding that the Accused _had_ an alcohol use problem, and that his alcohol use was linked to his offending. As Mr Cheng had already pointed out in PD2 at \[5\], “In my assessment, there is sufficient evidence as indicated by Ravindran’s claims that he was intoxicated on the day of the offence and was unable to recall his actions, to conclude that his alcohol use habit is linked to his offending behaviour and presents as a risk factor _regardless of the amount or frequency of his alcohol use_”. (Emphasis mine.) I agreed with this view. How much alcohol the Accused actually consumed during the material period and the frequency of such consumption was not the point. The important point was that the Accused had an alcohol use problem, and this was a risk factor contributing towards the Accused committing offences.

56     I was also satisfied that the finding by Mr Cheng that the Accused had failed to assume responsibility over his actions was well grounded. Counsel pointed out that the Accused had acknowledged that his actions were wrong, and that he was “candid” about the influence alcohol and the lack of medication had to play in his offending.[^9] In his written submissions, counsel argued that this showed the Accused was capable of consequential thinking. However, being candid and aware that these actions had led to the commission of the offences was not the same as taking responsibility for doing these actions. Mr Cheng’s point was a simple one – the Accused knew that these actions led to his offending, and yet he still went ahead to do them.[^10] Not only that, but the Accused also suggested that those were the reasons he had committed the offences[^11]. In other words, it was not his fault in drinking or stopping the medication. The fault lay in his state of intoxication and his state after not consuming his medication. The Accused did not accept that the present offences were his fault insofar as it was his own decision to consume alcohol and to stop taking his medication.[^12]

57     I accepted Mr Cheng’s reasoning here. I also found Mr Cheng’s assessment to be supported by other evidence:

> (a)     First I found it troubling that the Accused appeared to blame the mode of administration of the medication (oral ingestation), as the main reason why he had stopped taking it. He indicated that he wanted to switch to injected medication instead as the side effects were less severe. There was no indication at all from the Accused that he would be willing to comply with his medication _even if_ he was not able to switch the mode of administering. In other words, he appeared to be making a switch in administration as a condition which must be met before he would fully comply with his medication. This did not appear to me to be someone who realised the error of his ways and was trying to correct his actions. Reducing the side effects was clearly more important to him than ensuring that he did not continue committing offences and harming others.

> (b)     Second, the oral evidence the Accused gave in court was also telling. When asked why he had committed the present offences, he replied, “_I don’t remember exactly but the person at the home would keep disturbing me. He would wear slippers into the prayer area, that is why… He’s an old man. I only hit him lightly but he’s old and maybe that is why his jaw was fractured_.”[^13] It appeared to me that the Accused was trying to justify his actions against the victim, and downplaying them. This was also in line with Mr Cheng’s observations during the second round of interview with the Accused, where the Accused tried to justify and minimise his offences.

58     On the whole, I was satisfied that the grounds which Mr Cheng relied on to anchor his findings in the PD reports were sound and credible, and not weakened in any way by the peripheral objections the Accused took to certain aspects of the reports. I therefore relied on the findings made in the PD reports.

59     I was aware, of course, that the PD reports were not conclusive of the question of whether it was expedient to sentence the Accused to a sentence of PD. That is ultimately a finding for the court to make, after having taking into account all the relevant facts.

### Accused’s criminal history speaks for itself

60     In the present case, the Accused’s criminal history speaks for itself. A study of his records shows that from 1985 to the present day, the Accused had not been able to stay crime free in the community for any significant period of time. His list of offences also reflect violent behaviour, and a blatant disregard for authority.

61     Counsel for the Accused pointed out that in the recent years, the Accused appeared to have managed to stay crime free in the community for a longer period of time. This did appear to be the case, and might have something to do with the fact that he had been staying at the Home for the last few years, and would therefore have less access to alcohol.

62     Even so, as Mr Cheng pointed out, the Accused still did not manage to stay away from offending for even a period of two years.[^14] I also noted that he appeared to have committed offences within the Home in 2016 and 2017 (See s/n 44 and 46 in the table of offences set out at \[17\] above), which indicated to me that staying in the Home by itself was not sufficient to prevent the Accused from re-offending. Based on these, I did not find it significant that the gaps between his period of offending in the last few years seemed to have marginally increased.

63     What came across very strongly to me from the Accused’s criminal history was a pattern of re-offending, and there was nothing before me to indicate that this pattern would stop.

### No significant protective factors

64     The Accused had indicated to Mr Cheng that he intended to go through with a programme run by NAMS to deal with his alcohol problem. At the point of sentencing, nothing concrete was put forward, and Mr Cheng also offered his view that the programme might not be able to help the Accused stop his alcohol use.[^15]

65     The Accused had told Mr Cheng he intended to request for a switch to having injected medication in the future, but again nothing concrete was put before the court that anything has been done in this regard. In any case, there was no assurance that the Accused would really comply with his medication even if the mode of administering was changed.

66     As Mr Cheng pointed out, the Accused had not formulated any plans on how he would deal with high risk situations and triggers when he is out in the community in the future.[^16]

67     One factor that changed between the first and second PD reports was the potential of familial support for the Accused, which recently manifested itself in the form of the Accused’s elder sister who indicated her willingness to take the Accused under her wings upon his release. This was relevant, and Mr Cheng also gave his opinion that this could mitigate his risk for violent re-offending. In my view, this was the strongest factor in favour of the Accused, and the only one which gave me pause in trying to decide if a sentence of PD was appropriate and necessary in the present case.

68     However, this assurance of familial support was ultimately too vague and insubstantial to be relied upon. The Accused had not been in contact with his family members for the last 15 to 16 years, and it was simply not realistic to believe that a close and trusted relationship with his elder sister could immediately be formed upon his release such as to enable her to be in a position to adequately control and guide him in his efforts at rehabilitation and reintegration. It was also telling to me that this was not a point pressed by counsel, and no further details of how any care arrangements would be formulated was given to the court.

69     Given the Accused’s long history of offending, it seemed clear to me that there must be a strong underlying factor/s behind this, which would require more than just bare and vague assertions of change on his part, or bare and vague assertions of support from a long estranged family member, to break. Otherwise, the Accused would presumably have broken his habits long ago.

70     I was therefore not convinced that there were any significant protective factors in the Accused’s life which would adequately mitigate against the risk of him re-offending. Assertions of motivation and remorse, though heartening, were by no means sufficient assurance that change would happen.

### Nature of offences are serious

71     The offences committed by the Accused in the present case are serious ones, involving the use of violence. The attack on the victim was unprovoked and resulted in serious injuries including the loss of teeth and the fracture of the jaw. The attack against the police officers were not less severe, and any violence employed against our law enforcement officers cannot be condoned.

72     These were not the Accused’s first violent offences, and he has also shown a history of aggression towards public servants.

### Medical condition not a significant mitigating factor

73     As counsel candidly acknowledged, the Accused’s medical condition was not serious enough to warrant an exercise of judicial mercy. As far as the medical reports show, the Accused’s condition was not terminal and there was certainly nothing to indicate that there was a high risk of endangerment to his life if he were to be imprisoned.

74     With regard to whether it should nevertheless have a bearing on the Accused’s sentence in the form of mitigation, the Court of Appeal in _Chew Soo Chun_ indicated at \[33\] that this might be so if the medical condition would “cause imprisonment to have a disproportionate impact on the offender”. In my view, there was no indication that this would be so in the present case. The Accused appeared to be functionally well and there was no real doubt or dispute that Prisons would be in a position to manage his health and medical needs. As the Prosecution correctly pointed out, the Accused had in fact received crucial treatment and been brought to a stable state when he was in remand. The fact that the Accused may have a 30 – 40% chance of mortality in the next five years did not change with imprisonment and was therefore a “neutral factor” (see _Chew Soo Chun_ at \[39\]). In fact, when it came to having access to prompt medical attention, the balance may fall in favour of being in prison rather than out, given the Accused’s lack of financial means.

### A 10 year term of PD is necessary for the protection of the public

75     Having considered the recidivism assessment in the PD reports and the findings therein, the Accused’s long criminal history and lack of any significant protective factors or factors to mitigate the risks of his re-offending, the severity of the offences the Accused committed as well as the type of offences he appeared to be wont to commit, I was satisfied that it was expedient for the protection of the public that the Accused ought to be sentenced to a term of PD.

76     The Accused was previously sentenced to a term of 10 PD detention, and I thought this remained appropriate. I did not consider that there was sufficient basis to impose a lower term than 10 years. The Accused’s risk of recidivism was high, and in particular his risk of violent re-offending was worrying. While counsel pointed out that the Accused would likely be continuing to reside at the Home upon his release and therefore out of public circulation, I noted that the Accused had already been staying there for the last few years but that did not stop him from continuing his offence spree. There were no significant protective factors to justify a reduced term being given, unlike in the case of _Tang Hian Leng_.

77     Bearing in mind the seriousness of the offences committed in the present case, I was also of the view that a term of 10 years PD would not be disproportionate, given the paramount interest of protecting the public.

## Conclusion

78     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a term of PD for 10 years was justified and warranted, and imposed the same accordingly.
