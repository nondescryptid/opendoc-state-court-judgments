Civil Procedure – Experts – Single joint expert

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in RA 23/2020 .\]

30 October 2020

### Deputy Registrar Wong Choon Ning:

1       On 7 October 2020, parties applied to the Court to appoint a single joint expert (“SJE”) pursuant to Order 108 Rule (3)(b) of the Rules of Court. After hearing submissions from parties, I appointed one of the Plaintiff’s nominees as the SJE. On 13 October 2020, the Defendant filed an appeal against the appointment of the SJE. These are my grounds of decision.

## Background

2       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant was for property damage to the Plaintiff’s motor vehicle arising from a motor accident involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant. It encompassed a claim for $10,272 for the cost of repairs.

3       The Plaintiff and the Defendant each nominated two experts and furnished information on their expertise and years of experience, their charges for a physical inspection of the vehicle and/or a survey by reviewing documents only, the costs for their attendance at the trial or assessment of damages hearing, and the estimated time each expert would take to prepare the report. The information was furnished by way of a table which was tendered to the Court and served on the other party before the asynchronous Civil Dispute Resolution hearing (“aCDR”). The parties were not required to produce the full _curriculum vitae_ of their nominees by way of affidavits as the essential information was already provided in the tables tendered. Each party would also have received the other party’s nominees’ _curriculum vitae_ during the exchange of SJE proposals. None of the parties challenged the expertise or experience of the nominees stated in the table or requested for the _curriculum vitae_ of his nominees or the other party’s nominees to be placed before the Court. For my part, I did not need to probe further into the full _curriculum vitae_ of the four nominees. All of them had previously been appointed by me as the SJE in other cases. Both the Plaintiff’s Counsel and the Defendant’s Counsel gave written undertakings to produce their nominees’ _curriculum vitae_ and lists of charges as and when the Court required them to be produced.

4       After hearing the parties’ submissions, I appointed Mr Roger Gan, one of the Plaintiff’s nominees, as the SJE and gave timelines for the physical inspection or paper survey of the Plaintiff’s vehicle and the SJE report to be completed.

## Allegation of Default Appointment of the SJE

5       In the Notice of Appeal, the Defendant’s Counsel applied for the appointment of the SJE to be varied and/or set aside and stated that Mr Roger Gan had been appointed “\[b\]y default” by the Court as the SJE for the property damage. This carries the implication that this Court always appoints Mr Roger Gan as the SJE whenever he is named as one of the nominee. It also suggests that there was no thought given to the appointment of Mr Roger Gan as an SJE.

6       It is not true that this Court always appoints Mr Roger Gan whenever he is nominated by a party to be the SJE for property damage. The Defendant’s Counsel, Mr Willy Tay, knows that such a suggestion is false. On the same day when I appointed Mr Roger Gan as the SJE for this case, there was a similar application before me in another case where I declined to appoint Mr Roger Gan as the SJE. In that other case, MC/MC 16432/2019, the same two counsel had appeared for the Plaintiff and the Defendant respectively, and they had proposed the same four nominees. It was one of the Defendant’s nominees, Mr Choo Beng Hai, whom I appointed as the SJE in that case.

7       For a period of about one month, counting backwards from 7 Oct 2020 (the day when I made the appointment of the SJE for this case), there were a total of four cases (inclusive of the present case) where Mr Willy Tay had come before me to make submissions on the appointment of the SJE for property damage. Ms Anjalli d/o Mohan also appeared as counsel for the Plaintiffs in the four cases. In all the cases, Mr Roger Gan was one of the experts nominated by the Plaintiff. The details of the nominees and eventual appointments in the four cases are as follows:

In three of these four cases, I had appointed one of the Defendant’s nominees as the SJE. It was only on one occasion, the present case, where I had appointed the Plaintiff’s nominee, Mr Roger Gan, as the SJE.

## Exercise of the Court’s discretion

8       The appointment of an SJE is entirely within the discretion of the Court, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case. The Court will appoint the expert who is best able to assist the Court at the trial or the assessment of damages hearing (see _Lee Song Yam v Hafizah binte Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 24</span> at para 28).

9       In exercising my discretion in selecting which nominee to be appointed as the SJE for property damage in a non-injury motor accident (“NIMA”) claim, I would take into consideration the following non-exhaustive list of factors:

> (a)     The nominee’s level of expertise and years of relevant experience (that is, the nominee’s years of experience as a motor surveyor, as opposed to his years spent in the motor industry in some other capacity)

> (b)     The nominee’s costs of engagement including the costs of conducting a physical inspection of the motor vehicle or a survey by reviewing documents only, and his/her charges for court attendance;

> (c)     The length of time required by the nominee to prepare a report;

> (d)     The reliability of the nominee in discharging his functions in a timely and responsible manner;

> (e)     Whether any party had breached the regulations in the NIMA pre-action protocol which affected the other party’s position with regards to the appointment of an SJE; and

> (f)     Any allegation of claim inflation, bias and/or fraud against any of the nominees.

10     Some nominees would, in an apparent over-zealous effort to secure the Court’s appointment, make promises which they could not deliver. For instance, I have encountered nominees who represented that they could put up the report within a week or less from the date of inspection, but who eventually took far longer than two weeks to release the report. During the aCDR hearings which I conduct on a daily basis, I would receive regular updates from the parties, in their applications for adjournments, on the progress made by the SJEs (including SJEs who had been agreed upon by the parties) in their inspection of the vehicles and preparation of reports. This affords me with the opportunity to monitor and identify those experts who, based on their previous and current work performances, can be depended upon to discharge their functions in a timely and responsible manner if they were to be appointed by the Court as SJEs.

11     In the present case, three of the four nominees – Mr Lawrence Ng, Mr Roger Gan and Mr Choo Beng Hai – have close to, or more than, 20 years of experience as motor surveyors. I have also previously appointed them to be the SJE in other cases. Mr Roger Gan is the most experienced nominee, based on his 34 years of experience in this field. His charges were slightly lower than those quoted for Mr Lawrence Ng, and more or less on par with those for Mr Choo Beng Hai, depending partly on whether a physical inspection or a paper survey would be carried out.

12     Mr Peter Holce’s charges quoted in this case were substantially lower than those of the other three nominees. His rates for conducting a paper survey were only 40% to 60% of those quoted by the other three nominees. (This translated into a difference of $120 to $270.) Mr Holce is, however, the least experienced among the four nominees. Perhaps it was for this reason that the Defendant’s Counsel chose to emphasise on Mr Holce’s position, since June 2017, as the founder and Managing Director of a company, H2 Technical Services Sdn Bhd, and a consultant to an insurance company, Direct Asia Singapore, “to select all panel repair workshops, including contract drafting, negotiations and rollout of the new panel and strategic partner Franchise workshops”.

13     While the costs of engagement are a relevant factor in the Court’s consideration of who to appoint as the SJE, the nominee’s level of expertise and relevant experience is of greater importance. The objective is to appoint the expert who is best able to assist the Court by providing a fair, reasonable and impartial assessment of the property damage based on his expertise and experience. In my view, there should not be too much emphasis placed on the costs of engagement if the disparities are not large. Not all litigants enjoy the same economies of scale in their negotiations on the costs with the experts whom they can select to name as their nominees. If the pricing were to become a conclusive or determinant factor, the Court’s appointment of the single joint expert may devolve into an appointment of a single party’s choice of the joint expert.

14     In an earlier case, MC/MC 3368/2020, I had appointed Mr Peter Holce as the SJE even though he had the least experience among the four nominees. At that time, the Court was informed that he only had more than 3 years’ experience. His charges were slightly higher than those of Mr Roger Gan, who was also nominated by the Plaintiff to be the SJE. (The difference was between $100 and $200.) Notwithstanding this, I was prepared to appoint him as the SJE in a case where the claim for cost of repairs was less than $10,000. In the present case where the claim for cost of repairs exceeded $10,000, I declined to make a second appointment of Mr Peter Holce as the SJE.

15     For the present case, the Plaintiff and the Defendant had each engaged their own surveyor to conduct a pre-repair survey of the Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Defendant’s Counsel complained that, when the Defendant’s surveyor was at the repairers’ workshop on 18 Feb 2019, the repairers had “failed or refused to dismantle” the damaged parts in his presence. The Defendant’s surveyor was asked to return the next day at about 3 pm. He later found that the parts had already been dismantled. The Defendant’s Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff had, therefore, breached paragraph 2.2 of the NIMA pre-action protocol. In response, the Plaintiff’s Counsel submitted that paragraph 2.2 was applicable only when a joint surveyor, agreed upon by the parties, was conducting the pre-repair inspection. There was no breach of the NIMA pre-action protocol and the Plaintiff should not, therefore, be precluded from having one of their nominees being appointed as the SJE.

16     The wording of paragraph 2.2 of the NIMA pre-action protocol makes it clear that it is referring to a joint survey of the damage to the claimant’s vehicle prior to the commencement of repairs. Paragraphs 2.3 to 2.8 touch on the steps to be taken by the claimant and the insurer to exchange proposals for the motor surveyor who is to conduct the joint survey for both parties, and how the claimant may agree, or be deemed to have agreed, to the appointment of any of the motor surveyors listed by the insurer. It is only paragraph 2.9 which deals with the situation, such as ours, where parties are unable to agree on a joint survey and each party then engages his own motor surveyor to conduct a pre-repair survey. Unlike paragraph 2.2, paragraph 2.9 does not lay down any requirement for the repairers to allow the insurer’s motor surveyor to conduct a survey of the vehicle whilst the damaged parts are being dismantled prior to the commencement of repairs.

17     I would agree with the Plaintiff’s Counsel, based on the wording of paragraph 2.2 and 2.9 of the NIMA pre-action protocol, that there is no breach of the protocol. In any event, not every breach of the NIMA pre-action protocol will preclude the defaulting party from having their nominees considered for the appointment of the SJE. If the non-compliance results in a failure to preserve evidence with regards to the nature and extent of the property damage, the Court may be inclined to appoint the complying party’s nominee rather than the defaulting party’s nominee. One example will be where the claimant notifies the potential defendant and his insurer of the accident only after repairs to his vehicle have been carried out, effectively denying the defendant and his insurer any opportunity to conduct a pre-repair inspection.

18     In our case, the act complained of was the repairers’ failure or refusal to dismantle the damaged parts when the Defendant’s surveyor was at the repairers’ workshop on 18 Feb 2019 (Mon). According to the Defendant’s Counsel, their surveyor was asked to return the next day at about 3 pm. But, upon his return, the damaged parts had already been dismantled. The Defendant’s Counsel did not mention in his submissions whether the repairers had promised to dismantle the damaged parts for the Defendant’s surveyor, apart from letting him know that he could return to the workshop the following day at about 3 pm. It was also not mentioned in the submissions whether the Defendant’s surveyor had returned to the workshop the next day at 3 pm or at a later hour.

19     The Defendant’s Counsel added in his submissions that the Defendant’s surveyor had returned to the repairers’ workshop three days later, on 22 Feb 2019 (Fri), to conduct a post-repair inspection. No explanation was given as to why the Defendant’s surveyor did not conduct a pre-repair inspection on 18 and 19 Feb 2019 (Tues) when he was at the workshop, or why he waited till three days later to inspect the Plaintiff’s vehicle after the repairs had been carried out. The Defendant’s Counsel’s complaint for 19 Feb 2019 was that the damaged parts had already been dismantled, and not that the repairs to the Plaintiff’s vehicle had already been carried out. Where the Plaintiff’s vehicle was available for a pre-repair inspection and the Defendant’s surveyor chose not to conduct the inspection and instead waited till after the repairs had been carried before he conducted his inspection, it would not be fair to let the Defendant use their decision to conduct a post-repair inspection as a means to prevent the Plaintiff’s nominees from being appointed as the SJE.

## Conclusion

20     After a careful examination of the submissions made by parties, I appointed one of the Plaintiff’s nominees, Mr Roger Gan, as the SJE. It was my opinion that he would be best able to assist the Court with regards to the assessment of the property damage in this case.
