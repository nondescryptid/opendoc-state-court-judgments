\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9192/2021/01.\]

30 May 2022

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       Ng Cheng Kwee and Lee Lai Leng (Li Liling) are husband and wife. They were part of a criminal syndicate that, in the words of the Prosecution, “orchestrated the largest fraud involving government funds to date”.

2       Ng and Lee pleaded guilty before me for their role in this “largest fraud” (as well as to other charges not related to this particular “fraud”). After they were sentenced, they each lodged an appeal against sentence. Ng and Lee are currently serving sentence.

3       These present Grounds of Decision deal with the sentence meted out to Lee. The Grounds of Decision dealing with the sentence meted out to Ng are found in <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 112</span>. Where there are common facts in each case, these will be found in both these Grounds as well as the Grounds relating to Ng. Where appropriate, I shall refer to Ng and Lee collectively as the Accused Persons (the “AP”).

4       This “largest fraud” involved the said syndicate in which the AP were members, defrauding the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (“SSG”) to the tune of $39,944,296 through the submissions of 8,391 fraudulent claims. Of this sum in excess of $39.9 million, the total sums recovered by the authorities (in the form of cash, bank account balances, insurance proceeds, gold and jewellery) amounted to $18,603,922.30. A further sum of $21,000 was recovered from restitution by other members of the syndicate. Neither Ng nor Lee has made any restitution. The staggering balance sum of $21,319,373,70 remains unaccounted for.

5       Lee faced a total of 98 charges, of which 94 related to the fraud against SSG. The other 4 charges were for offences not related to SSG. Lee pleaded guilty to 16 charges before me (14 relating to the SSG fraud and two to offences of cheating not related to SSG). The balance of the charges, a total of 82, were admitted by Lee who consented to these charges being taken into consideration (“TIC”).

6       The Prosecution had sought a total sentence of between 174 to 180 months for Lee. The Defence had submitted that a total sentence of between 133 months and one week (on their lower end of their scale), and 155 months and one week (on the higher end of their scale) would have been appropriate. After considering the submissions of the Prosecution and the Defence, I sentenced Lee to a total sentence of 168 months. This was approximately 13 months more than the sentence submitted by the Defence (at the higher end of their scale). The total sentence meted out to Lee (168 months) was lower than the range submitted by the Prosecution (174 to 180 months). Only Lee appealed against the sentence meted out.

7       Quotations herein are taken largely from the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions. The Prosecution set out the following introduction: “In 2015, the Government launched the SkillsFuture national movement, aiming to encourage Singaporeans to engage in lifelong learning and skills development. As part of the SkillsFuture initiative, Singapore business entities who send their employees to attend skills training courses with registered training providers can apply to (SSG) for a subsidy of part of the course fees. This is known as the “Course Fee Grant” scheme.”

8       Between April and October 2017, the AP and other persons exploited the Course Fee Grant scheme, “by submitting fraudulent claims in circumstances where no trainings were conducted or attended”, thereby “(orchestrating) the largest fraud involving government funds to date”.

9       The AP had “used 9 dormant entities previously set up by them to obtain the course fee grants from SSG. These included 3 purported “training providers” and 6 ostensible “applicant entities””. Forged supporting documents were used to falsely give the impression that these dormant entities were “going concerns”.

10     In total, 8,391 fraudulent claims “were submitted to SSG on the SkillsConnect platform, on the (false) basis that the 3 training providers gave training to 25,141 employees of the 6 applicant entities. In fact, no such training courses were conducted, and none of the 25,141 individuals were even employees of the 6 applicant entities.”

11     As a result of these fraudulent submissions engineered by the AP, most claims “were automatically approved by SSG”, and “a staggering total of about $39.9 million was disbursed by SSG to the entities”. This formed the basis of DAC 903133-2019 under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (“CMCA”). This CMCA Charge was one of two charges that carried the two longest individual sentences that were made to run consecutively, in the final reckoning. The Prosecution again emphasised that “(more) than $21 million remains unaccounted for to date”.

12     The Prosecution narrates further, that a “small proportion of the claims were flagged for manual checks. SSG officers requested for submissions of supporting documents for these claims. The (AP) did so by submitting falsified attendance records, invoices and screenshots of funds transfers.” and that these were the subject of further cheating and forgery charges.

13     After the $39.9 million plus had been disbursed to the corporate bank accounts of 8 of the 9 entities, the Prosecution describes the consequent “(dissipation) of benefits of criminal conduct”. The Prosecution stated that “more than $27.8 million was thereafter withdrawn in cash from those corporate accounts via … bank transfers from the corporate accounts to other corporate accounts or personal accounts controlled by operatives in the criminal syndicate and thereafter withdrawn in cash by operatives, or … encashment of cash cheques drawn against the corporate accounts of 8 of the 9 entities by operatives in the criminal syndicate. Some of the cash was used by the (AP) to buy gold bars and gold jewellery. A large proportion of the cash and gold was kept in a safe in Lee’s brother’s house. The cash and gold were ultimately moved to the house of (Lee’s brother’s) friend in a frenzied bid to evade police detection and hamper recovery of criminal proceeds.” These dissipation activities were the subject matter of several money-laundering charges under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“CDSA”).

14     The Prosecution describes the next event of the criminality Lee (the “perversion of the course of justice”) thus, “Finally, when (Lee) got wind that things were going south, she frantically tried to cover her trails. For instance, she threw away her mobile phone containing her conversations with other syndicate operatives, in an attempt to conceal evidence relating to the offences. These are the subject of charges relating to perversion of the course of justice …”

15     As stated in \[5\], of the 16 charges Lee pleaded guilty to, 14 related to the SSG fraud. The remaining two proceeded charges related to two cheating charges unrelated to the SSG fraud, in which Lee, together with Ng and another co-accused person had participated in bank loan fraud against two separate banks. These events had occurred prior to the involvement of the AP in the SSG fraud.

16     The breakdown of the sentences meted out to Lee are contained in the Table below. The classifications, “Registration of entities”, “Submission of claims”, “Dissipation of criminal benefits”, “Perversion of the course of justice” and “Bank loan fraud” were authored by the Prosecution, and are useful to the discussion later relating to which sentences were made to run consecutively, and how they related to the total sentence finally meted out.

17     Both the Prosecution and the Defence submitted that five of the sentences should run consecutively (as shown in the Table at \[16\]). I was of the view that running only five sentences consecutively would achieve a fair yet condign sentence to properly reflect Lee’s total criminality in the SSG fraud as well as for the unrelated bank loan fraud. Ultimately, the five sentences ordered to run consecutively were for the five charges that both the Prosecution and Defence had indicated.

18     In terms of the individual sentences, the Prosecution put forth a very balanced and reasonable submission. I was persuaded by the Prosecution’s very careful treatment of the factors behind the submission for each of the proceeded charges. It also had to be borne in mind that there were 82 TIC charges to be considered. There was clearly a need to emphasise the sentencing principle of general deterrence. This was fraud involving Government monies on an unprecedented scale. It bears repeating that the criminal acts of the AP (and others) led to the illegal outflow of more than $39.9 million. What is more disconcerting is that a sum in excess of $21.3 million remains unaccounted for. Neither Ng nor Lee have themselves made any restitution.

19     I found the Prosecution’s submission on the individual sentences for the proceeded charges to be compelling. From the point of view of Lee’s circumstances, and in terms of mitigation value, what there might have been urged on Lee’s behalf was greatly dwarfed by the preponderance of aggravating factors. The submission of the Defence at times unconvincingly attempted to downplay Lee’s role in this illegal episode and the overall criminality of the whole venture. This demonstrated a marked lack of true remorse. It was indeed alarming to note that more than $21.3 million (being more than half the total sum defrauded) remains unaccounted for. However, there was room for a scaling down on the total sentence meted out to Lee as compared to Ng, on the basis of the lesser role Lee played in this illegal venture (as compared to Ng), and Lee’s mental and psychological issues. This will be discussed further, below.

20     Another aspect with regard to the total sentence that had to be recognised was that the sentences for only five of the 16 proceeded charges were run consecutively. Lee was sentenced to a total sentence of 168 months (approximately 13 months longer than the Defence’s submission of a sentence of 133 months and one week {on the higher end of their scale}).

21     This meant that 11 sentences were made to run concurrently. If we were to add up the total for the 11 concurrent sentences based on the sentencing submissions of the Defence, it would come up to a total of 199 months. These would be sentences that could be said to have been “foregone”.

22     The sentencing principles surrounding the totality of a sentence are well known and would delineate the outer borders that ought not be crossed. The total sentences “foregone” had to be carefully considered when the “last look” at the total sentence is had. Clearly, the total sentence meted out to Lee could not be crushing. Yet, the total sentence had to be carefully calibrated to recognise the measure of the total criminality demonstrated by Lee in this illegal enterprise.

23     With regard to the Prosecution’s submission on the totality of sentence, there was again a clear demonstration of palpable fairness on the part of the Prosecution. The Prosecution chose one sentence from each of the five demarcated areas of criminality demonstrated by Lee. These were for “Registration of entities”, “Submission of claims”, “Dissipation of criminal benefits”. “Perversion of the course of justice” and “Bank loan fraud” (the offences not related to the SSG fraud). The four categories that relate to the SSG fraud are a timeline series of events starting from the hatching of the fraudulent scheme through to the actual defrauding, to the resultant “money laundering” and the attempt to “cover up”.

24     For the category “Registration of entities”, the Prosecution could well have justified running the sentence for DAC 923021-2018 (for which they sought a sentence of between 8 to 10 months) or for DAC 923026-2018 (for which they sought a sentence of between 4 to 6 months) consecutively. Instead, they only sought to run the sentence for DAC 923024-2018 (for which they submitted that a sentence of 4 to 6 months would have been appropriate, but scaled down to the submission they finally arrived at, 1 to 3 months {as an adjustment for “totality}).

25     For DAC 923024-2018, the Defence had indicated that a range of 1 to 3 months would be appropriate, before finalising their submission at 1 month. I was of the view that a sentence of two months was appropriate and this was one of the five sentences ordered to run consecutively.

26     With regard the “Submission of claims” category, the Prosecution could well have justified running one of the section 420 sentences consecutively as well.

27     For the CMCA charge (DAC 903133-2019), Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 85 months was appropriate, and scaled this down to 82 months (as an adjustment for totality). The Defence had earlier indicated that a sentence of between 78 to 84 months was appropriate, before finalising their submission at 78 months. The Defence thereafter modified their submission for this charge to 60 to 78 months. I was of the view that a sentence of 80 months was appropriate and this was one of the five sentences ordered to run consecutively. The sentence of 80 months was lower than that sought by the Prosecution (“adjusted” at 82 months), and within the range of 78 to 84 earlier indicated by the Defence as appropriate.

28     For the CDSA charges under the category of “Dissipation of criminal benefits” the total sentences “foregone” (for 4 concurrent sentences) are quite lengthy, individually and in total. (The sentences meted out for these 4 concurrent sentences were 60 months, 42 months, 70 months and 42 months.) Due to the staggering amounts involved in the CDSA charges, again, the Prosecution could well have easily justified the running of one of these 4 sentences consecutive as well.

29     For the sentence for the CDSA charge that was run consecutively (DAC 941868-2017), the Prosecution submitted that 86 to 90 months would be appropriate, and scaled their submission downwards to 83 to 87 months (adjusted for totality). The Defence had earlier indicated that 70 to 74 months would be appropriate before settling at 70 months. The Defence thereafter modified this to 66 to 70 months. I found the Prosecution’s submission for this particular sentence to be the more persuasive. For this charge, a sum of some $6.7 million and 11 kg of gold (total $7,368,880) was involved. I was of the view that a sentence of 80 months was appropriate and this was one of the five sentences ordered to run consecutively.

30     There was no question that the sentence for the section 204A charge should run consecutively, that being the only charge under the category of “Perversion of the course of justice”. The need for general deterrence was high for this particular offence. Similarly, it was appropriate for one of the sentences relating to the “Bank loan fraud” to run consecutively. The Prosecution submitted that the sentence for DAC 941321-2018 should run consecutively, although this carried the lower sentence for this category (as compared to DAC 941320-2018). The Prosecution could have justified seeking the longer of the two sentences to run consecutively: there were two charges to be TIC in this category.

31     All considered, the Prosecution’s submission on individual sentences and the total sentence was more appropriate as compared to the positions taken by the Defence. It has to be further emphasised, that in coming to its individual sentencing and total sentencing positions, the Prosecution had carefully measured Lee’s culpability against Ng’s. I felt that the Prosecution had been correct in their estimation of the proportionality of Lee’s culpability and had adjusted (downwards) the sentences sought against Lee in a very fair and reasonable manner. Further, the Prosecution had very carefully taken into account the medical reports relating to Lee’s mental and psychological issues and had consequently further adjusted downwards their sentencing position. Again, the Prosecution had done this in a very fair and reasonable manner.

32     Having noted that the Prosecution’s submission on sentence had been very fair, reasonable and appropriate in all the circumstances, I was of the view that the total sentence meted out to Lee could still be adjusted downwards. It was clear that Lee would suffer immeasurably being kept in custody for a prolonged period of time. She has three young children and being kept away from them and missing their formative years would have a great impact on Lee. Lee still had to be punished for all her illegal acts, and the individual sentences and the total sentence meted out would send out the necessary message that a sentence of this magnitude would invariably carry. Bearing in mind that Lee’s acts were in part carried out under the influence of Ng, and the further consideration of her mental and psychological issues, a total sentence below the range sought by the Prosecution would still serve its purpose.

33     Thus, for three of the five sentences which were ordered to run consecutively (including the two longest sentences), I calibrated the individual sentences below the submitted values sought by the Prosecution.

34     The total sentence meted out to Lee was below that sought by the Prosecution. I was mindful that the sentence, whilst having to reflect the level of criminality demonstrated by Lee, had to be reasonable and not be crushing. Lee’s total sentence was Imprisonment for 168 months, backdated to 3 November 2017.

35     It bears repeating that this case involved the said syndicate in which the AP were members, defrauding SSG to the tune of **$39,944,296** through the submissions of 8,391 fraudulent claims. Of this sum in excess of $39.9 million, the total sums recovered by the authorities (in the form of cash, bank account balances, insurance proceeds, gold and jewellery) amounted to $18,603,922.30. A further sum of $21,000 was recovered from restitution by other members of the syndicate. Neither Ng nor Lee has made any restitution. The staggering balance sum of **$21,319,373,70** remains unaccounted for.
