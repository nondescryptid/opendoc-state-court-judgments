### District Judge Marvin Bay:

### Introduction

Mr Danny Eliezer Vaswani had, upon serving the requite portion of his sentence for drug-related offences, been released from in-prison custody on 13 February 2018, and allowed the suspension of the remaining term of his sentence, subject his compliance of the terms of a Conditional Remission Order[^1] from 13 February 2018 to 13 October 2019, which included his residence in a halfway house, in this case Selarang Halfway House. While resident there, Mr Vaswani had been allowed periods of ‘time-offs’ where the he was permitted to remain outside the premises for a strictly stipulated period. On 27 June 2018, Mr Vaswani was found to have breached the timeline of a time-off, which required him to return at 8.00pm that day. Mr Vaswani remained uncontactable, despite attempts to ascertain his whereabouts by the halfway house. As per their protocol, a police report was lodged on 29 June at 3.55 pm.

2       Mr Vaswani was only found on 4 July 2018, when he was discovered at a Hotel 81 at 21 Lorong 8 Geylang. At Room 818 of the Hotel 81 establishment where he was found, attending police officers arrested Mr Vaswani upon suspicion of his having consumed specified drugs and possession of controlled drugs.

#### The charges

3       Before the court, Mr Vaswani was charged with Prisons Act and Misuse of Drugs Act offences. The charge[^2] under s 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) reads:

> (You; Mr Vaswani) are charged that you, on 29 Jun 2018, in Singapore, while being subject to a remission order from 13 Feb 2018 to 13 Oct 2019 (both dates inclusive), made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.), which remission order is subject to mandatory aftercare conditions under section 50V(3) of the said Act, did commit a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of your remission order under regulation 151H(1)(a) of the Prisons Regulations (Cap. 247, Rg. 2), to wit, by failing to remain indoors at your place of residence at such time as specified in your remission order in accordance with section 50V(3)(c) of the said Act, for a cumulative period of 24 hours, whereby you have breached curfew hours between **27 June 2018 and 4 July 2018 with a total of 136 hours and 50 minutes**, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 50Y(1)(a) of the said Act.

> You shall therefore be liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 472 days from 29 Jun 2018 to 13 Oct 2019 for that offence. \[Emphasis in the original\]

4       The charge[^3] under s 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) reads:

> (You; Mr Vaswani) are charged that you, on **4th July 2018, at 3.50 a.m, at 21 Lorong 8 Geylang Hotel 81, Singapore**, did possess a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, **3 straws containing not less than 1.61 grammes of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.03 grammes of diamorphine**, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the said Act… \[Emphasis in the original\]

5       As Mr Vaswani had been previously[^4] convicted of an offence of possession of a controlled drug, he would be liable to be sentenced to at least the **_mandatory minimum term_** of two years’ imprisonment,

6       Mr Vaswani’s re-offending while the condition remission order was in force, also fell foul against a basic condition imposed under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act he was liable to be punished under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **467 Days[^5].**

7       Mr Vaswani also faced a proceeded charge[^6] under s 9 of the MDA for the possession of utensils intended for the consumption of a Class A controlled drug. This charge also carried enhanced punishment under s 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act.

### Pertinent background information and admitted facts from the Statement of Facts

8       While the foregoing would give a sense of the presenting circumstances, it would be conducive to clarity to set out the pertinent facts in the statement of facts to afford an understanding of Mr Vaswani’s specific admissions. The following is a paraphrased summary of the contents of the statement of facts, with some rearrangements for narrative coherence.

### Items found in at the time of arrest

9       On 4 July 2018, when police officers arrested Mr Vaswani at Hotel 81, Singapore, upon their suspicion of his having consumed specified drugs and possession of controlled drugs. The following items were recovered in his assigned room; Room 818: -

> i)     three cut straws containing brown granular substance

> ii)     one opened cut straw containing a brown granular substance wrapped in a piece of aluminium foil

> iii)     Seven slabs of an apparent medication marked '_epam'_ containing 20 tablets each, a single slab of _'epam'_ containing 16 tablets, 1 slab of 'epam' containing eight tablets, and one slab of _codeine phosphate_ containing 14 tablets

> iv)     three rubber bands, a burnt piece of aluminium foil, a rolled up paper, and a pair of small scissors.

### Fact pertaining to the first charge (MAC-906662-2018)

### Admission into Mandatory Aftercare Scheme and terms of Remission order

10     Mr Vaswani had signed and acknowledged the contents his Remission Order on 13 February 2018, as well as the fact that contents of the said Remission Order had been fully explained to and understood by him. The Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS) conditions were set out in the Remission Order, and these conditions were effective in Mr Vaswani’s case for the duration between 13 February 2018 to 12 August 2019.

11     The MAS conditions, _inter alia_, required Mr Vaswani to reside at Selarang Halfway House. Which was situated at 1 Cosford Road, and to abide by the curfew timing daily from 10pm to 6am or as otherwise indicated by the staff of Selarang Halfway House.

12     Mr Vaswani was given approved times off on two relevant dates:

> (i)     27 June 2018 from 7.00am to 8.00pm

> (ii)     28 June 2018 from 7.00am to 8.00pm

13     Mr Vaswani had no approved time off after 8.00pm on either 27 or 28 June 2018. Notwithstanding this, on 27 Jun 2018, upon the expiry of Mr Vaswani’s approved time off at 8.00 pm, he was found to have failed to return Selarang Halfway House, and remained incommunicado despite attempts to reach him.

14     As Mr Vaswani appeared to have wilfully remained out of Selarang Halfway House in breach of his curfew for more than 24 hours, Mr Joseph Lee Eng Hao, the Manager of Selarang Halfway House proceeded to lodge a police report on 29 June 2018 at 3.55 pm against Mr Vaswani.

15     Thereafter, a Police Gazette was issued against Mr Vaswani. Mr Vaswani remained at large until 4 July 2018 at 3.50 am, when Police conducted a spot check at No 21 Lorong 8 Geylang Hotel 81. After the arrest mentioned above, Mr Vaswani was brought back to Bedok Police Division, where he had admitted to failing to remain indoors at Selarang Halfway House for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours.

16     Mr Vaswani admitted to not being able to provide any valid reason for his breach. Mr Vaswani had committed a breach of curfew hours between 27 June 2019 to 4 July 2018 by failing to remain indoors at Selarang Halfway House for a cumulative total of **136** hours and **50** minutes. Mr Vaswani accordingly admitted to the having committed a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of the remission order under regulation 151H(1)(a) of the Prisons Regulations (Cap. 247, Rg. 2), for failing to remain indoors at his place of residence in accordance with section 50V(3) (c)[^7] of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.), an offence punishable under section 50Y(1)(a) of the said Act. This rendered Mr Vaswani liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 472 days from 29 June 2018 to 13 October 2019, pursuant to section 50Y(1)(a) of the said Act.

### Facts Relating to the 2nd and 4th charges (DAC-930215-2018 & DAC-931212-2018)

17     Analysts from the Health Sciences Authority’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory examined the three samples and established that

> (i)     The contents in three straws amounted to some 1.61 grams of granular/powdery substance which was found to contain not less than 0.03 grammes of Diamorphine, a Class A Controlled Drug.

> ii)     the content of another exhibit, which comprised a straw contained not less than 0.02 grammes of granular/powdery substance which was found to contain Diamorphine.

18     Mr Vaswani admitted to having in his possession a burnt piece of aluminium foil and a rolled-up paper which he intended to use for the consumption of diamorphine.

### Antecedents

19     Mr Vaswani has a prodigious criminal record with no fewer than 25 entries in his CRO 60. Since Mr Vaswani was given the minimum sentence for the drug possession charge which was ordered to run consecutively, I have not segregated the drug and non-drug antecedents. Essentially, it would be more salient to analyse his antecedent record holistically, with a view to articulating considerations of deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. The drug antecedents are nevertheless highlighted in boldface font for easy identification. Mr Vaswani’s first term of imprisonment was imposed in 1996, when he was just 22 years in age.

20     As can be seen from the recounting of his dismal record, Mr Vaswani’s parlous conviction record shows a pattern of cyclical re-offending which is heavy represented in anti-social, threat and violence offences, including repeated instances of breaches of protection orders and criminal intimidation offences. Most remarkably Mr Vaswani was received a **two-year** sentence for criminal intimidation in July 2008, just after he received a **_four-year_** sentence for the same genre of offence in October 2002.

21     In terms of Mr Vaswani’s drug treatment history, Mr Vaswani had two admissions into drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs), with the former commencing on 21 February 2001, and the latter on 26 November 2009. He received respective DRC extensions of nine and 12 months in the two instances. The two DRC admissions had made Mr Vaswani eligible for the long-term class one (LT 1) sentence, upon his morphine consumption charge in May 2015. For completeness, Mr Vaswani has been placed on 24-month drug–supervision regimes on three instances on 16 May 2002, 25 May 2011 and 13 February 2018.

### Mitigation plea

22     Counsel stated that Mr Vaswani had been beset by two traumatic events, which had occurred after his released from prison custody on 13 February 2018 from his LT1 sentence to serve his conditional remission term at Selarang Halfway House.

23     The first such event had been the passing of his uncle on 30 April 2018. Mr Vaswani had been reportedly close to his uncle, who had raised him like his own son, and who ‘_helped to mediate family disputes which occurred very frequently_’[^8].

24     The trauma of the uncle’s passing was exacerbated by Mr Vaswani’s own travails. At and around the time, Mr Vaswani had been hospitalised for six weeks upon onset of diabetes complication, which has escalated to the point that he had developed a coma had been warded in an intensive care unit (ICU) for about a week. Mr Vaswani’s uncle had suddenly passed away just a day after Mr Vaswani had regained consciousness from his own medical crisis, and being transferred to a normal care ward when he learnt of his uncle’s sudden demise. This had, according to counsel, dealt a ‘_huge blow emotionally’_[^9].

25     Mr Vaswani suffered a second blow when his own mother passed on 23 June 2018 at age 77. Mr Vaswani’s mother had been in ill-health having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Dementia, and been bedridden for some four to five years, and been in the care of her sister. Mr Vaswani’s mother had been living with and was dependent on the his (Mr Vaswani’s) sister until the sister passed away on 18 November 2015. Mr Vaswani stated that he had been very close to his mother, who had been a homemaker and was directly involved in raising him and his siblings. The deaths had affected Mr Vaswani as these had been in the wake of a series of earlier bereavements. Mr Vaswani had lost his father in 2006 and two brothers in quick succession some four months thereafter, all from various illnesses. This left Mr Vaswani deeply traumatised as he was the only extant member of his family. Counsel adds[^10] ‘_(h)is exact words to us are that he is the only one left and that he has no other family’_.

### Mr Vaswani’s alleged contemplation of self-harm

26     Defence counsel indicated that he had been instructed to inform the court that Mr Vaswani had ‘_contemplated suicide on the particular day that he was arrested with the drugs’_, and that _‘(h)e had planned to overdose on the drugs seized, as well as other drugs including various pills and a bottle of vodka’_.[^11]

27     Given these concerning revelations, Mr Vaswani had evidently not provided his counsel with any significant details of this attempt at self-harm. The Statement of Facts does show Mr Vaswani being in possession of eight slabs of pills marked _‘epam’_ as well as a slab of _codeine phosphate_. The pills do not seem to have been subject to any toxicological analysis from the documents filed. Mr Vaswani has not furnished any information of the provenance, or even the nature[^12] of these pills. This leaves the court in an unenviable position of having to extrapolate between the items found as identified solely by their external packaging, and this troubling disclosure by counsel of Mr Vaswani’s reported attempt. Given counsel’s submission in the mitigation plea, I would still have to, in the interests of justice, try to make sense of the aforementioned situation, despite the paucity of information offered.

28     It is a sufficiently notorious that ‘_epam_’ is a shortened form of _diazepam_, and used as a trade name. _Diazepam_ is a _benzodiazepine_, a class of sedative drugs. It is a forensically proven fact that _benzodiazepine_ overdose, especially when taken in a cocktail of other illicit narcotic substances and drugs (such as _codeine_), with alcohol (as reported by counsel) can cause severe respiratory depression; and possibly, death.

29     Nevertheless, I would note that counsel has very carefully couched this revelation in the form that he was ‘**_instructed to inform’_** of Mr Vaswani’s suicide attempt. This caution is understandable. Counsel has presented no toxicological evidence that Mr Vaswani ingested any, much less a potentially lethal quantity of _benzodiazepines_ and/or _codeine sulphate_ pills. At his arrest, Mr Vaswani had not been noted from available exhibits to be in any respiratory distress or heavily sedated state characteristic of mixed-drug toxicity, nor was he subject to any gastric lavage or other attempt to purge his stomach contents of any over-dosage of drugs that he was suspected to have ingested. The _epam_ and _codeine_ pills do not appear to have been removed from their packs, and aggregated to prosecute any attempt to end his life, Hence, other than the stockpile of these drugs found, intact in their blister-pack slabs, there is no evidence that Mr Vaswani, had at the point of his arrest, begun preparations for, much less made any serious attempt to complete, any act of suicide. The stockpile eight _epam_ and one _codeine sulphate_ slabs would thus be, at best, weak circumstantial evidence of Mr Vaswani. Given the inconclusive nature of the presented circumstances, only Mr Vaswani would truly know what the true purpose of the stockpile of _benzodiazepines_ and _codeine_ was for; whether to be consumed wholesale for self-harm, or to be applied intervally within a recreational pattern of consumption (_eg_: taken intermittently in small doses, or for sporadic drug binges).

30     Notwithstanding this, I fully accept that Mr Vaswani was in a severely depressed state, arising from the demise of two close relatives, and that this depressed state of mind **_might_** have predisposed him to contemplate self-harm.

### Sentencing submissions by prosecution

31     The prosecution sentencing proposed included a reasoned and principled basis for how sentences for s 50Y and s50T should run. As the span of the sentences and the manner these sentences ran would form the crux of Mr Vaswani’s presumptive dissatisfaction against the sentence imposed, I will set out the prosecution’s submission in detail. I should add that I am in **_general agreement_** with the approach and calibrations made by the learned DPP, and only differ, in one significant respect, in my view on an aspect of offender-specific considerations.

32     DPP Kevin Ho proposed the following specific sentences for the proceeded charges:

> (a)     MAC-906662-2018 (s 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act) – 150 days’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC-930215-2018 (s 8(a) of the MDA) – 2 years’ imprisonment + 158 days’ imprisonment (for the s50T breach)

> (c)     DAC-931212-2018 (s 9 of the MDA) – 4 to 6 months’ imprisonment + 158 days’ imprisonment. DPP Ho submitted that the sentences for MAC-906662-2018 (150 days imprisonment), DAC-930215-2018 (2 years imprisonment) as well as the enhanced sentences (158 days + 158 days imprisonment) run consecutively.

33     I noted that DPP Ho was not proposing any sentence higher than the mandatory minimum for the possession offence under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, and the proposed 4-6 month sentence span for the drug paraphernalia charge was within the well-established benchmarks for an offence under s 9 of the MDA, the principal focus was to propound a sentencing framework.

34     I noted that this was a fully principled framework which sought to rationalise the factors set out in s 50T (3) of the Prisons Act, and was congruent to the Prisons Act injunction that the court ‘shall’ consider the factors in s50T(a)–(c).

35     The approach was for the court to consider the factors under s 50T(3)(a)–(c) of the Prisons Act to derive the sentencing band. The second stage of the inquiry was to contemplate if the indicative starting sentence ought to be adjusted upwards or downwards, contingent on the presence of ‘any other relevant circumstances’ provided by s 50T(3)(d) of the Prisons Act).

36     For the first stage, where offence-specific factors under s 50T(3)(a) -(c) of the Prisons Act were considered, the learned DPP characterised the factors at play for s 50T(3)(a)-(c) of the Prisons Act to fall into the following categories:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.62%"> <col width="22.92%"> <col width="27.52%"> <col width="24.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Factor</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Lower severity</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Moderate severity</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Higher severity</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50T(3)(a): the</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">gravity of the offence</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mr Vaswani’s fresh offences were for consumption and possession offences under the MDA.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Minute quantities of drugs possessed</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50T(3)(b): whether the sentence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The fresh offence is of a similar nature to the LT1 offence and possession offence for which he was placed under the remission order</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50T(3)(c): the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mr Vaswani re-offended approximately 5</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">months after released</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">on remission order</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

37     The next stage would entail the calibration of the indicative starting point. This was facilitated by using a Band Sentencing range:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.12%"> <col width="34.22%"> <col width="34.66%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing range</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Elaboration</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 day to 1/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the above checklist, if the overall severity of the case</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">may be considered ‘<b><em>low’</em></b>, the sentence may fall within this band.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the above checklist, if the overall severity of the case may be considered <b><em>‘moderate’</em></b>, the sentence may fall within this</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">band.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to maximum</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on the above checklist, if the overall severity of the case may be considered <b><em>‘high’</em></b>, the sentence may fall within this</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">band.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

38     The learned DPP indicated that the overall severity of Mr Vaswani’s offending would place him at the higher end of Band 2.

39     Accordingly, the indicative starting sentence would be the higher end of the range between 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximum (of 467 days). This would compute to between 156 and 311 days’ imprisonment in respect of each offence. DPP Ho indicated his view that an indicative starting sentence would be 275 days’ imprisonment in respect of each offence.

40     For the third stage consideration of ‘any relevant circumstances’ under s 50T(3)(d) of the Prisons Act, the sole identifiable one would be that Mr Vaswani elected to plead guilty. The learned DPP proposed a one-quarter from the 275 days indicated, yielding a figure in the region of 206 days’ imprisonment for each charge.

### Proposed Sentencing Framework for s 50Y of The Prisons Act

### Offence specific factors for section 50Y sentencing

41     The learned DPP proposed a parallel regime for section 50Y Prisons Act cases, that mirrored the previously mentioned approach for section 50T sentencing, with the initial step to consider offence-specific factors within the criteria provided by s 50Y(2)(a)-(c) of the said Act:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.34%"> <col width="33.32%"> <col width="33.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Offence-specific factor</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Factors to consider (non-exhaustive)</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(a): the gravity of the serious breach</p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-Duration of the breach</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-Motivations and reasons behind the breach</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(b): the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where an offender committed the breach within two months.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where an offender committed the breach within two to four months.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where an offender committed the breach after more than four months (ie, a significant time would have elapsed on the remission order)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lower</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(c): whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society</p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Whether offender abided by other conditions of his release (if any)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Whether offender continued to remain gainfully employed</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Whether offender committed any offence</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Motivations and reasons behind the serious breach</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

42     With this yardstick, the learned DPP submitted that Mr Vaswani’s overall culpability should be considered in the following manner:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.68%"> <col width="24.26%"> <col width="24.26%"> <col width="24.8%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offence-specific</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">factor</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">low culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">moderate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">high culpability</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(a): the gravity of the serious breach</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Breached his curfew for 136 hours and 50 minutes without any valid reason</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(b): the length of time for which the person did not commit any breach of a mandatory aftercare condition after being released under the remission order</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offended within 5 months from his release on 13 February 2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50Y(2)(c):</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Whether the serious breach evidences a lack of commitment by the person to his rehabilitation and reintegration into society</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender committed drug offences during the breach of curfew</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

43     The next stage would entail the derivation of an indicative starting sentence using the same sentencing bands approach, spanning the spectrum of three bands:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.5%"> <col width="34.56%"> <col width="33.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Severity</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 day to 1/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to maximum</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

44     DPP Ho opined that a juxtaposition of the factual matrix Mr Vaswani against the sentencing bands would yield an overall culpability at the higher end of Band 2, between 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximum possible term of 472 days. As the indicative range of starting sentences would be approximately between 157 to 315 days’ imprisonment. He posited that the indicative starting sentence would be 300 days’ imprisonment.

### Considering offender specific factors

45     The third stage of the proposed framework for sentencing of a s 50Y(2)(d) of the Prisons Act offence would be the consideration of offender-specific factors within the rubric of ‘all other relevant circumstances’ in s 50Y(2)(d) of the Prisons Act. A set of aggravating and mitigating factors was accordingly advanced:

46     Given that Mr Vaswani had pleaded guilty, DPP Ho proposed a one quarter ‘discount’ resulting in a sentence of 3/4 x 300 days, which would compute to 225 days’ imprisonment. The learned DPP suggested that the totality principle might call for a further downward adjustment to **_150 days’_** imprisonment to be imposed in respect of the s 50Y offence.

### Calibrating The Global Sentence

47     The learned DPP was mindful that Mr Vaswani faced two offences (s 8(a) and s 9 of the MDA) which attract enhanced punishment under s 50T of the Prisons Act. Section 50T(2)(b) of the said Act provides that where a person commits two or more offences in breach of the basic condition of his remission order, the **_aggregate length_** of all the enhanced sentences imposed shall not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order. The aggregate length of the enhanced sentence is 206 x 2 = 412 days’ imprisonment, which did not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order.

48     Considering the fact that Mr Vaswani also faced both s50T and s50Y charges, DPP Ho suggested a last set of adjustments. At \[16\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence, he invites the court to:

> … take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case, and assess whether the overall sentence (including the individually calibrated enhanced sentences under s 50T) is just and proportionate, having regard to broader public interest considerations and to the offender’s total criminality. Taking into account the totality principle (including the fact that the s 8 and s 9(a) offences were committed on the same day), as well as the fact that the accused also faces a substantial imprisonment term in respect of the s 50Y offence, it is submitted that the overall enhanced sentence under s 50T of the Prisons Act should be no more than 316 days’ imprisonment in total (or 158 days’ imprisonment in respect of each offence).

49     Given this, the prosecution’s position was that the total sentence under s 50T and s 50Y of the Prisons Act should be 316 days + 150 days, which was **_466_** days’ imprisonment in total.

### Sentencing submissions by defence

50     Mr Vaswani’s counsel had alternate positions on sentencing, with the primary position being that Mr Vaswani should receive a global sentence not exceeding 25 months and 300 days. This was premised on the following

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.86%"> <col width="37.12%"> <col width="25.6%"> <col width="24.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>No.</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Charge</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Sentence</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Breach of MAS (S50V(3)(c)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1 month</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Enhanced Possession of <em>diamorphine</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years (mandatory</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">minimum)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Enhanced Possession of <em>methamphetamine</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>taken into consideration</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of drug utensils</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50T(2)(b)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Enhanced Sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">300 days</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Enhanced Sentence</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">for Charge 2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TOTAL</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>25 months and 300 days</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

51     This quantification had been made when the defence had a misapprehension[^13] that the prosecution was seeking a sentence seeking ‘the maximum 472[^14] days’ for the section 50Y offence, as well as an enhanced sentence of 300 days under section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act, alongside the mandatory minimum 2 years for the enhanced possession charge, rather than the 2 years and 466 days actually sought.

52     Counsel pleaded that Mr Vaswani had ‘_conceived suicidal ideations and accordingly breached curfew in order to overdose on drugs to end his life. He was facing the immense weight of grief following the death of his mother and uncle’_. Counsel therefore sought as follows:

> 15.    The Defence humbly submits that the Accused should not be subject to a cumulative penalty (under Section 50T and Section 50Y) exceeding the full remainder of the remission order. In light of the mitigating factors cited above, an appropriate sentence in the present would be:-

>> An enhanced sentence of 300 days per Section 50T, and 1-month imprisonment term for Section 50Y offence.

53     Counsel was candid that his submission was for Mr Vaswani to serve (along with the mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment for the _diamorphine_ possession charge) a one-month term for the s50Y charge and **_300 days’_** imprisonment, rather than the actual remission default period of **_467 days_** for the s50T charge, ran **_against the grain_** of other cases dealing with concurrent breaches of section 50T and section 50Y of the Prisons Act. Simply stated, there are **_no cases_** which would support the defence’s formulation for a one-month sentence for a section 50Y Prisons Act offence, in a situation where the accused would **_not_** be required to serve the **_full remission_** term for the section 50 T Prisons Act offence.

54     In the course of his sentencing submissions, counsel made reference to a District Court judgment in _Public Prosecutor v Chandrasegaran s/o Raman_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 105</span>. This judgement helpfully referenced cases to illustrate typical examples of sentencing of cases within this this genre of concurrency of section 50 Prisons Act offences. That case involved just a single s50Y Prisons Act charge, where the accused was sentenced to the full remission term of 592 days.

55     In that case, reference was made to two unreported cases; _Public Prosecutor v Ramachandran s/o Maniam_ (DAC 939303-2017) and _Public Prosecutor v Ng Beng Heng_ (DAC 916207-2017) which had the parallel situations of concurrent s50Y and s50T charges being proceeded with.

56     Defence counsel was forthright in conceding as follows[^15]:

> 11.    (the District Judge) in _Chandrasegaran_ noted that: -

>> \[24\] “the only instances where the imprisonment term for s 50Y(1)(a) has been shorter than the full remission period is where the accused already faces an enhanced sentence under s 50T of the Prisons Act for a separate offence committed during the remission period.” …

> 12.    (the District Judge) then went on to cite the sentences of _Ramachandran_ and _Ng Beng Hong_: -

>> (a)    In PP v Ramachandran s/o Maniam (DAC 939303-2017), the accused breached curfew timings at the halfway house for a total of 27 hours and 25 minutes. He was sentenced to **_one months’ imprisonment under s 50Y(1)(a), having been given an enhanced sentence of 362 days for an offence committed under s 506 of the Penal Code pursuant to s 50T_**, which represented the full remainder of his remission period.

>> (b)    In PP v Ng Beng Heng (DAC 916207-2017), the accused breached curfew at the halfway house for a total of 83 hours and 19 minutes. He was sentenced to **_one months’ imprisonment under s 50Y(1)(a), having been awarded an enhanced sentence (under s 50T of the Prisons Act) of 375 days for an offence under Reg 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations_**, which was equal to the remainder of his remission period. \[Emphasis in the original\]

### Counsel’s fall-back position on sentencing

57     Perhaps mindful that the sentencing position proposed above would was both unpersuasive and unsupported by precedent cases, defence counsel proposed an alternative in the following terms[^16]:

### Defence counsel’s alternative sentencing quantifications were actually higher than DPP’s final quantification

58     There is no small irony here that defence counsel’s quantification for the above global sentence term of **_30 months and 300 days_** imprisonment was some **_16 days higher_**[^17] than the DPP’s recommended quantification in their final sentencing position on **_two years’ and 466 days’_** imprisonment. While it might be argued that there is some **_‘anchoring effect’_** from counsel’s apparent misconception that the prosecution would be making a somewhat higher quantification, it would still point to the prosecution’s quantification being essentially fair, given that the defence had inadvertently proposed a **_higher_** quantification for Mr Vaswani’s eventual global sentence. Ultimately, it is quite evident that there is a substantial ‘ballpark’ agreement given the **_near-convergence_** of the competing global sentence proposals to fall within a 16-day difference.

### Background and complementary objectives of the Conditional Remission System and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme

59     It would be useful to understand the bases for the creation of the respective Conditional Remission System and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme regimes. For a more contextualised understanding of the considerations involved, I will delve into the objectives of the Conditional Remission System and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme as disclosed by the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, when the complementary schemes were introduced during the passage of the Prisons (Amendment) Bill on 20 January 2014. SMS Masagos elucidated the rationale and inter-connection between the respective schemes[^18].

> Currently, inmates are granted one-third remission for good conduct and behaviour in prison, that is, if they have not breached prison discipline. There are no conditions imposed upon their release. In contrast, many jurisdictions have moved away from their colonial precedents. The UK and its former colonies like Canada, New Zealand, and Hong Kong have, over time, implemented parole or conditional release systems that impose conditions on inmates when they are released. This creates the incentive for good behaviour upon release…

> **_The CRS seeks to deter ex-inmates from re-offending by subjecting them to conditions upon their release. All inmates will be subject to the CRS upon release. In addition, selected groups of ex-inmates who are of higher risk of re-offending or who will need more help in rehabilitating and reintegrating with society will not only be subjected to the CRS but will also be emplaced on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme._** The MAS is a structured step-down programme that could include a halfway house stay, aftercare support, counselling, electronic monitoring and curfew hours, as well as case management upon their release. While in prison, inmates undergo rehabilitation programmes and are closely supervised...

60     From the foregoing, it is plain that the scheme is intended to be a form of _‘_**_earned remission’_** as against an unconditional discount which was formerly the case. The intent behind this was, as stated in the passage, to incentivise continued crime-free conduct, at least within the period of remission.

61     SMS Masagos also articulated the nature and basis for the rehabilitative programme under the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme in the following manner:

> The MAS will be for a period of up to two years. It comprises three phases: a halfway house stay, home supervision and community reintegration. Prisons will make a holistic assessment for each individual based on factors, such as the nature of the offence, criminal antecedents, progress in prison, risk of reoffending, and family support, in deciding which phases the individual goes through…

### My decision on sentence

62     As alluded to earlier in these grounds. I am in broad agreement with the learned DPP’s approach in this case. Mr Vaswani might not have realised this, but he has already received exceptional consideration in this case. DPP Kevin Ho had formulated a global sentence recommendation of 150 days’ imprisonment for the 50Y Prison’s Act charge, and 216 days for the s50T charges (apportioned equally to 158 days per charge), allowing for a consecutive sentence of 466 days’ imprisonment. The term of 466 days is in fact one day short of the maximum permissible term of 467 days’ imprisonment for the breached remission term. As the discussion above would amply show, the **_usual_** sentence has been for s50T Prison’s Act offences for the commission of fresh offences within the remission period has been an imprisonment term equivalent to the remission term. Over and above the imposition of these sentences for the section 50T offences, an **_additional_** term of imprisonment would be imposed for the 50Y offences for breaches of curfew or abscondment from halfway houses. This was true of all five cases[^19] referred to in _Chandrasegaran_ (inclusive of the case itself). It is plain that the two provisions are **_distinct_** offences, as one could commit a s 50Y offence by breaching curfew without committing a fresh offence[^20], and it is concomitantly possible for fresh offences to be committed contrary to s50T, **_without_** any issue of a breach of curfew. This would certainly be the case if the offender is no longer in the halfway house phase of the mandatory aftercare scheme. A violation of **_both_** section 50Y and 50T, such as an abscondment from a halfway house, followed by the commission of crimes outside, whether they be sexual, property, violence or drug-related offences should thus be regarded separate breaches, ordinarily deserving an uplift in the final global sentence. This explains the rationale for consecutive sentences being imposed in these cases, with an additional term of a month or so of imprisonment, over and above the serving of the **_full remission term_** for the s50T Prison’s Act offence. Thus while Mr Vaswani would ordinarily have received a sentence of a month or more **_above_** the section 50T remission period of 467 days, the DPP was now proposing a total sentence for the section 50Y and 50 T offences which was one day lower than the maximum term for the section 50T offence.

63     My brother-judge in _Chandarsegaran_ has pointed to the obvious **_moral hazard_** in imposing a sentence which fell significantly short of the remission term: stating at \[25\]:

> 25    In short, once the accused breaches the terms of remission, whether by committing a further offence or by breaching the terms of the remission order, he should, unless the breach was _de minimis_ or good cause was shown, serve out the remainder of his remission period as a term of imprisonment. **_Anything less would lead to the perverse outcome that a recalcitrant accused who abuses the privileges of the early release programme could emerge as a free man earlier than another who had been compliant._** To my mind, there is a need for a proverbial Sword of Damocles to hang over the accused’s head, providing sufficient deterrence to incentivise compliance with the rehabilitative programme designed for his eventual reintegration into society. \[Emphasis added\]

64     The very valid considerations militating against imposing a sentence **_lower_** than the period of remission might, nevertheless, differ in some measure where the offender faces an especially heavy **_mandatory minimum_** sentence, as is the case here, where Mr Vaswani faces a minimum two-year sentence for the enhanced-penalty possession charge. In such a situation, the moral hazard risk identified, of a defaulter receiving a lighter punishment than his CRS compliant counterpart, would be diminished, and the court would need to holistically consider all salient factors to derive a fair sentence, as the aggregation of the section 50Y, section 50T and mandatory minimum sentence might, without appropriate **_attenuation_**, yield a disproportionately harsh result.

### Further downward adjustment of sentence from offender-specific considerations

65     In this regard, Mr Vaswani has already received significant concessions from the DPP in their proposing a sentence that was **_lower_** (albeit marginally) than the section 50T remission period rather than the **_higher_** overall sentences which are commonly seen where a section 50 Y breach had preceded the section 50Y Prison’s Act.

66     I noted here that the learned DPP had only listed Mr Vaswani’s early plea of guilt as a mitigatory ground. I was of the view that Mr Vaswani’s state of mind in the wake of the dire familial developments mentioned above, **_did_** play a role in his impetuous decision to breach his curfew, and engage activities which found him in a hotel room with an agglomeration of narcotic drugs, prescription medications, benzodiazepines, alcohol and drug paraphernalia, some 137 hours after his abscondment from the MAS regime. Mr Vaswani had completed some five months before his breach. He had also suffered some dramatic reversals in his health, and had learned of his uncle’s demise after emerging from a diabetic keto-acidiotic coma on 30 April 2018. He had suffered another loss on 23 March 2018, and had breached curfew, committed the proceeded fresh offences days after. As mentioned, while I am satisfied that he was likely in a depressive state, I am wary of Mr Vaswani’s claim that he had planned to commit an act of suicide at the hotel room, given that there is no evidence of him having taken any such course of action, other than accumulate the drugs, unopened slabs of _‘epam’_ and _codeine_ tablets, and vodka, which were found within in his possessions at the Hotel 81 room. The presence of the items in themselves would be ambiguous, given Mr Vaswani’s very **_long history_** of drug use, or rather; abuse, which has led him to two stints at drug rehabilitation centres in 2002 and 2009, and an eventual LT 1 conviction for drug consumption in 2015, where the drugs in question for proceeded and TIC charges were _diamorphine_ and _methamphetamine_, the self-same pair as in the instant case.

67     Given this, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to accord a **_further_** discount to his section 50T Prisons Act sentence by 40 days, from 316 days’ imprisonment to 276 days’ imprisonment. Adopting the DPP’s convention of equally apportioning the section 50 T terms over the section 8(a) and section 9 Misuse of Drugs Act offences to 158 day’s imprisonment per charge, I accorded consecutive sentences of 138 days per charge.

### Ex-tempore sentencing remarks:

68     Before imposing sentence, I pronounced the following brief sentencing remarks[^21]:

> It is most unfortunate that you squandered your chance given by your early release. You had breached your approved time-off stayed away from the halfway house at Selarang for a considerable period from 27 June-4 July 2018. This is the s50Y offence.

> 2.    You keep falling into the thrall of drugs, having reverted to drugs again and again, you have also faced drug charges involving _diamorphine_, including the possession of the same, which will attract a mandatory minimum sentence.

> 3.    I note that you had suffered double personal tragedies. It is clear that you are, at 44, no longer a young person. I do not propose to give you a crushing sentence, but one that is still suitably deterrent.

### Sentence imposed

The global term of two years' and 426 days’ imprisonment was ordered to run from Mr Vaswani’s first remand, which had commenced on 5 July 2018

### Conclusion

70     As can be seen, Mr Vaswani received the mandatory minimum sentence for the section 8 (a) _diamorphine_ possession MDA charge. The six-month sentence for his section 9 MDA charge (possession of drug paraphernalia) had been ordered to run **_concurrently_**, and would thus would not have counted as a constituent element contributing to the aggregation of his final sentence. I must thus conclude that Mr Vaswani’s dissatisfaction with his sentence must emanate from a sense that the section 50Y and section 50T Prisons Act charges were unduly harsh.

### Considerations of general deterrence

71     I would comment that it still remains necessary for the court to ensure that the **_deterrent_** effect in sentencing.is not diminished by overly lenient sentencing. The primacy of deterrence as a fundamental principle in sentencing defaulters of the Conditional Remission and Mandatory Aftercare Schemes is quite evident as SMS Masagos in his address to Parliament:

> However, at the end of the day, even with the additional support and aftercare provided to the ex-offender, **_it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to re-offend. If he does, he will be dealt with swiftly and strictly by the law._** \[Emphasis added\]

72     Hence, while I was inclined to ameliorate Mr Vaswani’s sentence to a degree, in view of the factual matrix including likely trauma and depression from two personal tragedies, the court was still bound to ensure that the sentence would still be one which would serve as a fitting deterrent against reoffending. Essentially, the dictates of **_general deterrence_** require offenders to realise that the privilege of an earlier release from prison custody which the Conditional the Conditional Remission and assistive Mandatory Aftercare Schemes afford, carry a concomitant obligation that the conditions imposed be rigorously observed, and that severe consequences will ensue for breaches of the licence afforded by the schemes. This explains why the penalties commonly require the offender to return to serve the entire remission term in prison.

### Specific deterrence necessary given Mr Vaswani’s criminogenic traits

73     Further to the above, Mr Vaswani’s antecedent record shows a crying need for **_specific_** deterrence to procure his desistance from further offending. As indicated above, Mr Vaswani’s criminal record comprises 25 separate entries, and documents ten separate instances between 1996 and 2015 where he had been separately convicted and sentenced for a variety of offences. The fact of these offences involving repeated instances of criminal intimation (1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2008 and 2013), breaches of protection orders (1999, 2008 and 2012) and causing hurt offences (1997 and 2013).

74     From this troubling record, Mr Vaswani seems disinclined to reflect on past mistakes, and displays a clear tendency to give vent to his baser impulses to reoffend. This propensity is taken to breath-taking levels from the fact that received a **_four-year_** sentence for criminal intimidation October 2002, following three prosecutions for the same offence in 1996, 1997 and 1999). This prolonged stint of imprisonment did little to dissuade him from offences of this nature, as he received another **_two-year_** sentence for criminal intimidation in July 2008. Sadly, for Mr Vaswani, this was not the end of the story, as he received yet another sentence of **_two years and three months_** upon another charge of criminal intimidation in 2013.

75     Mr Vaswani, now aged 44, has repeatedly failed to see that he is the sole author of his unfortunate situation, brought about by repeated cycles of offending of various offence genres. It is hence all too plain that the court, while properly expressing sympathy for his personal tragedies and health reversals, cannot ignore the need to impose a suitably denunciatory and deterrent global sentence in Mr Vaswani’s case. I would repose a hope that he can use his term of incarceration to reflect and gain some insight on how the consequences of his crimes have blighted his prospects of leading a productive and fulfilling life.

76     With all these considerations, a ‘last look’ at all the described facts and circumstances of this case sufficed to convince me that the overall sentence, and individual sentences had been calibrated with sufficient care to serve as a just and proportionate punishment. I was of the view that the sentence was responsive to the broader public interest considerations, while properly addressing the requirements of the totality principle[^23] with the effect of the sentence on Mr Vaswani to not be crushing and being a condign punishment, which is, in the final analysis, entirely in keeping with his past record and his future prospects.

[^4]: On 13 May 2015, Mr Vaswani had been sentenced in a District Court vide DAC 0930056/2014 for the possession of diamorphine for which he received a one-year imprisonment trem.

[^5]: As calculated from 4 July 2018 to 13 October 2019.

[^8]: At \[4\] of Mitigation Plea.

[^9]: At \[5\] of Mitigation Plea.

[^10]: Mitigation Plea at \[8\].

[^11]: Mitigation Plea at \[8\].

[^12]: The HSA certificates (Exhibits P1 and P2) from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory contain only an analysis of the powdery/granular samples found which were established to contain _diamorphine_. Mr Vaswani has also consented to a TIC charge for methamphetamine possession, but the certificates have not been exhibited for the purpose of the PG mention proceedings.

[^13]: At \[10\] of the Mitigation Plea, counsel states: 10. The Defence is given to understand that the Learned Prosecution is asking for a sentence of maximum 472 days for Charge 1, as well as an enhanced sentence of 300 days under Section 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act. This is on top of the mandatory minimum 2 years in respect of Charge 2.

[^14]: The actual term the accused would be liable for the section 50Y breach would be **472 days: ** commencing from the day of his curfew breach on 27 June 2018, and **467 days: ** for the section 50T offences, calculated from the date of his drug-related offences; 4 July 2018.

[^15]: At \[11\]- \[12\] of the Mitigation Plea.

[^16]: At \[16\] of the Mitigation Plea.

[^17]: Defence counsel’s second proposal is for Mr Vaswani to serve a global sentence 30 months and 300 days. 30 months, or two and a half years, as represented in days would be 365 times 2.5=912.5 days. 912.5 plus 300 would be **1212.5: ** days (rounded off to 1212 days). On the other hand, the prosecution’s proposal of 2 years and 466 days would be (365 times 2) plus 466.The sum of 730 days plus 466 days would yield **1196: ** days. 1212 days’ minus 1196 days would amount to an excess of **16 days: **.

[^18]: As recorded in _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_, 20 January 2014, vol 91.

[^19]: These two cases were also mentioned at \[23\] of the judgment of _Chandasegaran:_(i) _PP v Ramli Bin Abdul Rahim_ (DAC 932167-2017), where the accused breached curfew at the halfway house for a total of 624 hours and 3 minutes, he received a sentence of imprisonment for the **full remaining remission period: ** of 465 days.(ii) _PP v Shahrul Bin Shamsudin_ (DAC 909989-2017), where the accused breached curfew at the halfway house for a total period of 119 hours and 28 minutes, he was imposed a term of imprisonment for the **full remaining remission period: ** of 438 days.

[^20]: This is in fact what happened in _Chandrasegaran_ itself, where the accused had broken curfew as he wanted to locate his mother, but did not know where she stayed. During his period of breach of 115 hours, the accused claimed that he did not have a fixed place of abode and had stayed at void decks and public parks, but was not implicated in any fresh offence while ‘at large’.

[^21]: The full _ex tempore_ remarks can be found in the Notes of Evidence, 7 August 2019, Pages 12-14.

[^22]: All s50T sentences are consecutive.
