Damages – Assessment

Insurance law

8 October 2019

### Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan:

1       This is an assessment of damages (“AD”) arising in an action for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident.

2       On 9 Jun 2016, the plaintiff (“P”), then aged 53, was injured when she, as a rear seat passenger in a taxi, was thrown forward upon impact onto the rear of the front passenger seat. This left P with a constellation of facial, oro-dental, head, knee and hip injuries, for which she sued.

3       Below are the essential grounds for my decision, some of which have been elaborated upon since I first conveyed my decision to parties.

## General damages for pain and suffering

4       Many of the parties’ submissions were based on precedents and on the _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the _Guidelines_”). As a general point, I accepted P’s submission that my award should take into account inflation since the time the awards in the _Guidelines_ were rendered,[^1] because it is eminently fair and the defendant (“D”) did not submit otherwise. My awards are to be taken to have considered the effect of inflation.

### Facial injury: lower and upper lip lacerations

5       P suffered lacerations in the middle of the upper lip and the middle and side of the lower lips. They were sutured.

6       P submitted that $5,000 should be awarded.[^2] In this regard, P cited the _Guidelines_, which posit at Chap 1, para G(f) that facial lacerations attract $2,500–$5,000, and that the award is higher in cases where the laceration leaves a scar that cannot be completely removed by cosmetic surgery, especially where the injured person is a young female. P drew my attention to photos taken during her recovery process,[^3] and emphasised a few points: _first_, the fact that scars attract a separate award; _second_, the fact that these were lacerations at both the lower & upper lips; and _third_, she was a female plaintiff.[^4] $5,000 should be awarded, being the upper end of the range posited in the _Guidelines_.

7       D, however, submitted that $1,500 should be awarded, being the lower end of the range posited in the _Guidelines_ for multiple lacerations in Chap 8, para D(b) (_ie_, $1,500–$3,000) instead of that for facial lacerations.[^5] D noted that the medical reports did not state the time taken for the lacerations to heal, document any complications in the healing process, or record any scars.[^6] Further, P was 53 years old at the time of accident.

8       I awarded $4,500 in damages.

9        **_First_**, I rejected D’s submission that the range of $1,500–$3,000 should apply. Apart from the fact that the _Guidelines_ expressly stated that such a range did _not_ apply to facial lacerations, the posited range of awards for facial lacerations offered far more guidance than that for regular lacerations. An award for pain and suffering compensates for physical pain, emotional and intellectual suffering arising from the injury (_Au Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 290</span> _per_ KS Rajah JC at \[11\]). In my judgment, the more generous awards for facial lacerations is explicable on the basis that a laceration on the face often inflicts more emotional suffering than a laceration elsewhere, all other things equal. It often affects one’s self-image more profoundly, and attracts more unwanted attention. It often inflicts more physical pain, too; mere common experience tells us not only that the face is often more sensitive to pain than other parts of the body, but also that it is more difficult to exclude the use of the face in some of the most basic day-to-day living. This case, in fact, is an excellent example of why facial laceration awards are more generous. While P’s lacerations were healing, P would have experienced pain and inconvenience when eating and drinking, when speaking, or even when making facial expressions.

10      **_Second_**, I doubted D’s submission that the award for facial lacerations should be higher for young females (all other things equal), for which no authority apart from the _Guidelines_ was cited to me. That may suggest that young females are as such entitled to feel more embarrassment or emotional suffering than male or older persons. While not intending to trivialise P’s suffering, I was unable to accept that as a universally true principle. Instead, it seemed to me that the reference to young females might well be shorthand for the class of persons that can reasonably be expected to experience relatively more emotional suffering from cosmetic injuries. Perhaps young females are thought, rightly or wrongly, to have placed more subjective importance on their outward appearance or to have invested more in it. It might also well be that, all things being equal, a younger plaintiff should receive a higher award for injuries with permanent cosmetic effects because he or she is expected to live with these injuries for a longer time. At best, the only fact which might properly let me infer that P might experience relatively more emotional suffering from facial injuries was that she was a beautician by trade (which led me to presume that she had some regard for the importance of facial care).

11      **_Third_**, I noted that the lacerations appeared to have healed well and the medical reports did not mention lasting scars. It was unclear what I should have made of P’s argument that scars attract a separate award. It would not be entirely persuasive, should her point ultimately be that the award for facial lacerations should not be decreased on account of a lack of a scar. This is because scarring may well be one indicator of the severity of the injury. That said, the fact that stitches were administered[^7] indicated that the lacerations were still considerably deep.

12      **_Finally_**, I considered my award to be in line with _Chan Wei Siang v Chye Yen_ (DC Suit No 314 of 2009) (“_Chan Wei Siang_”), where $5,000 was awarded in early 2012 (_ie_, about $5,500, if adjusted for inflation) for a degloving laceration of the anterior maxillary alveolus, which required stitching of the upper lip and alveolus. While the injuries in both cases required stitches, I found the present case to be slightly less serious. Although there were two lacerations rather than one, neither seemed as severe or extensive as a degloving injury.

### Oro-dental injuries

13     P suffered complex dental injuries to her maxilla and front 8 teeth (_ie_, all 8 incisors). To be brief, I will use the FDI notation as follows:

> (a)     #11 — upper right central incisor;

> (b)     #12 — upper right lateral incisor;

> (c)     #21 — upper left central incisor;

> (d)     #22 — upper left lateral incisor;

> (e)     #31 — lower left central incisor;

> (f)     #32 — lower left lateral incisor;

> (g)     #41 — lower right central incisor; and

> (h)     #42 — lower right lateral incisor.

14     One tooth (#42) suffered a subluxation. While D disputed that the accident caused this particular injury,[^8] I found that it did.

15     Two teeth (#21 and #31) were fractured and avulsed at the time of accident, of which one (#31) involved a root fracture.

16     Two teeth (#32 and #41) suffered horizontal root fractures. Three (#11, #12 and #22) were implicated in an anterior maxillary dentoalveolar fracture. These two sets of fractures were stabilised with composite-wire splints, but after the splints were removed, the prognosis was poor for two teeth (#11 and #22); they were then extracted by a simple alveoplasty of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge.

17     #12 (_ie_, the tooth that survived the maxilla fracture) and #32 (_ie_, one of the two teeth that suffered a horizontal root fracture) received root canal treatment. A crown for #12 with post-core would be required although it was pending at the time of the AD. #41 had been planned for root canal treatment and filling, but in the event received only tooth-coloured restoration. No treatment was rendered in particular for #42, although it remained loose. In respect of #41 and #42, the doctor ordered six monthly reviews to consider if root canal treatment was required should the teeth became non-vital (this risk, fortunately, did not materialise).

18     For the four lost teeth, dentures were fabricated. About 10 months post-accident, three procedures were done under general anaesthesia: _first_, a bone graft to the upper anterior dentoalveolar region over #11, #21 and #22 from the left ramus mandible; _second_, a bone graft to #31; and _third_, an excision of the root fragment from #31. Since about 1.5 years post-accident, P had been undergoing staged implant surgery to receive, _first_, a provisional prosthesis; _next_, a definitive crown and bridge implant prosthesis; and _third_, an implant crown for #31. There was a _final_ step—an implant bridge for #11–#22—which, at the time of the AD, had not yet been done. As a result of these procedures, P was required to medicate, maintain a soft diet, observe good oral hygiene, and use a pressure gauze if there was bleeding.

19     P submitted in opening that $30,000 be awarded for her dental injuries. This was effectively revised to $39,000 in closing submissions. P cited the _Guidelines_, which posit a range of $1,500–$2,500 per tooth lost, and a range of $1,000–$2,000 per tooth fractured. However, these had been based on precedents dating back to the late 1990s–early 2000s.[^9] Accordingly, with inflation, $14,000 should be awarded for 4 lost teeth (_ie_, $3,500 per tooth) and $10,000 should be awarded for 4 fractured/subluxated teeth (_ie_, $2,500 per tooth). P also submitted that a separate award of $15,000 be made for the “anterior maxillary dentoalveolar \[fracture\]”. In this regard, P cited the _Guidelines_, which posit that a maxilla fracture should attract a $10,000–$20,000 award (with the award being in the higher range for a young or female plaintiff, and especially if recovery is complicated),[^10] and also _Tarun Kumar Manharlar Sanghavi v Ho Beng Neo_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] SGHC 70</span>[^11] (“_Tarun Kumar_”) and _Seek Tiong Hock v Heng William (Wang William) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 239</span>[^12] (“_Seek Tiong Hock_”). P highlighted that that she was unable to take solid foods as she could not chew, and she suffered severe pain and discomfort during her procedures.

20     On the basis of my findings, D submitted that only $10,000 should be awarded in total, being $1,500 per lost tooth and $1,000 per fractured/subluxated tooth. In this regard, D in substance highlighted the risk of overcompensation arising from overlap of awards for multiple injuries.[^13] In this regard, D cited _Lua Bee Kiang (Administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”), where the court held that the claimant’s multiple skull and facial injuries were all broadly in the same region of his body such that it would be artificial to render an award suggesting that each injury contributed to his suffering, pain and loss of amenity in a special and distinct way. D also sought to distinguish _Tarun Kumar_ and _Seek Tiong Hock_ as they supposedly involved different fractures.

21     I awarded $27,000 in damages.

22     On the whole, I was minded to make a large award, given that the injuries were complex and entailed a long recovery process. Having regard to the severity of each injury and the duration/complexity of the treatment required, I was inclined to award $30,000 for the oro-dental injuries in total, notionally comprising the following:

> (a)     #42 subluxation — $1,700;

> (b)     #41 horizontal root fracture — $2,200;

> (c)     #32 horizontal root fracture — $2,500;

> (d)     #31 fracture & avulsion — $3,100;

> (e)     #21 fracture & avulsion — $3,500; and

> (f)     Maxilla fracture involving eventual loss of #11 and #22 and fracture of #12— $17,000.

23     For the injuries to #42, #41, #32, #31 and #21, the _Guidelines_ posit, at Chap 1, paras  K(a)–(b), an award of $1,500–$2,500 per tooth lost, and $1,000–$2,000 per tooth fractured. However, this part of the _Guidelines_ are based on decisions dating back to the 1990s, and in my view should be inflation-adjusted in the region of 30–40%.

24     As for the maxilla fracture, the _Guidelines_ posit, at Chap 1, paras G(c) and K(a)–(b) an award of $10,000–$20,000. In arriving at my provisional view of $17,000, I took my cue from six decisions.

25     The first three are _Seek Tiong Hock_ and two decisions that it relied on—_Errol Sanath Nanayakara v Juan Badathuruge Buddilal_ (Suit No 312 of 1996) (“_Errol_”), where $9,000 was awarded in 1997 for the fracture of the maxilla; and _Teng Kui Thai and another v Goh Chwee Kim_ (Suit No 70 of 1993) (“_Teng Kui Thai_”), where $20,000 was awarded in 1996 for the comminuted fracture of the left maxilla and both zygomas. These awards, adjusted for inflation, would have been about $12,500 and $28,000 respectively. In _Seek Tiong Hock_ itself (a 2005 decision), $13,000 was awarded for fractures of both maxillae (or about $16,000 if adjusted for inflation). Since this case involved the fracture of one maxilla and three teeth (and the eventual loss of two), the pain and suffering is in my judgment worse than the simple maxilla fracture in _Errol_, comparable to if not slightly more serious than the fractures of both maxillae in _Seek Tiong Hock_, but perhaps not quite as severe as the comminuted fracture of the left maxilla and both zygomas as in _Teng Kui Thai_.

26     The _fourth_ decision is _Vaerakkanuh a/l M Parumanam v Tan Moh Huat and another_ (MC Suit No 30038 of 2002). $12,000 was awarded in 2004 (or about $15,500 if adjusted for inflation) for 2 fractured/extruded teeth in the upper jaw and a dentoalveolar fracture involving all 4 incisors in the lower jaw. This was treated by wiring the teeth, crowning, root canal treatment on the lateral incisor, occlusal adjustment on the teeth, and extraction of upper wisdom teeth. The present case is considerably more severe given that 8 instead of 6 teeth were injured, that 4 teeth were eventually lost, and that there was a maxillary fracture. The _fifth_ decision is _Chan Wei Siang_. In 2012, the Court there awarded $8,000 for a dento-alveolar fracture of the anterior maxilla, and $5,000 for the loss of 2 central upper incisors. Adjusted for inflation, these would be about $9,000 and $5,500 respectively. Again, I found the present case more serious than the sum of these two injuries. The _last_ decision is _Thangaraj Subramani v Hwee Mene Civil Engineering Pte Ltd_ (MC Suit No 13829 of 2000). $13,500 was awarded in 2002 (or about $18,000 if adjusted for inflation) in total for the loss of 2 teeth, and dentoalveolar or teeth fractures implicating 8 other teeth in total. This involved the extraction of 3 teeth, re-implantation of 1 tooth, and the splinting of teeth. Eventually, the plaintiff needed a denture. The present case is somewhat comparable. It is worse to the extent of the maxilla fracture and the rather more protracted treatment process for the fractured teeth; but, on the other hand, the injuries here involved 8 teeth rather than 10, and the treatment ultimately did not lead to the plaintiff having to use a denture.

27     I was generally hesitant to discount the award any further for overlap here. Forceful is the argument that it would be artificial to render an award suggesting that each of these injuries contributed to P’s pain, suffering and loss of amenity in a special and distinct way. I noted that the treatment to the teeth was carried out together, which leads to an overlap in pain and suffering that in turn tends to reduce the award. However, on another view, the total loss here is more than the sum of its parts. As P injured all 8 incisors, she lost way more tearing function across her teeth than had she simply lost a single incisor. One might well turn the argument on its head and argue that the award should instead be compounded, by analogy to the reasoning that total blindness/deafness attracts more than double the award for blindness/deafness in one eye/ear because the further blindness/deafness in the remaining ear/eye would devastate a plaintiff so much more. In fairness, the injury of 8 incisors is not as extreme as the irreparable loss of one of the senses, and should accordingly be viewed in a proportionate manner. In my judgment, the compounding and discounting effects could appropriately be thought to nearly cancel out in this case, such that the total sum of $30,000 I was inclined to award for the oro-dental injuries should be discounted but only by a modest 10%. Accordingly, I awarded $27,000.

### Head injuries — Post-traumatic benign positional vertigo

#### Whether the accident caused the injuries

28     On 29 Sep 2016 (_ie_, 3.5 months post-accident), P was diagnosed with post-traumatic benign positional vertigo, by Dr Ho, a neurologist in private practice. I found, as P claimed, that this was caused by the accident.

29     D had disputed this claim on grounds of causation.[^14]**_First_**, D argued that there was no contemporaneous evidence of vertigo. The orthopaedic specialist, Dr Chang, who examined P 1 month post-accident, mentioned P’s orodental injuries but not her complaints of vertigo.[^15] **_Second_**, Dr Ho’s conclusion was apparently based on complaints rather than scientific tests, as P appeared normal based on the clinical tests and examinations mentioned in the medical report.[^16] In this regard, D cited _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span> (“_Lee Mui Yeng_”), in which Kannan Ramesh JC held that the claimant did not prove that the accident aggravated her pre-existing knee osteoarthritis, as the claimant did not allege trauma to her knees in her affidavit evidence, and there was no reference to pain in her knees until 18 months post-accident.[^17]

30     I could not accept D’s submissions.

31      **_First_**, as P pointed out,[^18] Dr Ho definitively concluded that the accident caused the vertigo; he said that the injury was “very likely” post-traumatic in origin because the accident and symptoms were close in time. This conclusion was not internally inconsistent with his given premises. I also note that P had been struck in the face with enough force to cause complex orodental injuries. If anything, it was for D to persuade me that Dr Ho’s conclusion should not be accepted on its face. Yet, D did not cross-examine Dr Ho on the issue of causation. Neither did D raise any other kind of medical evidence that contradicted Dr Ho’s apparent line of reasoning.

32      **_Next_**, I hesitate to hold against P the fact that Dr Chang mentioned her orodental injuries but not vertigo. D neither cross-examined Dr Chang on the nature and comprehensiveness of his history-taking, nor cross-examined P on her complaints to Dr Chang. For completeness, I also do not make much of the fact that this was not complained of at A&E because she had far more pressing injuries to attend to. There is no evidence to say when complaints of vertigo should have been expected from P.

33      **_Third_**, _Lee Mui Yeng_ did not overcome the problem that this issue had not been explored in cross-examination, since it appears that the doctors in that case did give evidence on the stand. At any rate, _Lee Mui Yeng_ did not provide me any useful analogy. The complaint there had arisen 18 months post-accident; it appeared markedly different from complaints of symptoms happening virtually contemporaneously with the accident and documented 3 months post-accident. Also, in the first place, the injury there was orthopaedic in nature whereas the injury here appeared neurological. In my judgment, it seems understandable if neurological injuries are not noticed and documented immediately, but it is harder to overlook this for orthopaedic injuries.

#### Quantum of award

34     P had complained of 1–2 episodes of rotatory vertigo per day since the accident, each lasting about half a minute. She was admitted on 19 Oct 2016 to undergo an MRI, but this revealed no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage or cerebral contusion. Nonetheless, she was medicated with betahistine (48mg, twice daily) for 2 weeks. On 20 Jan 2017, she reported improvement in her dizziness—she would just experience a few seconds of dizziness upon tilting her head back—and was discharged from regular follow-up with no further treatment required.

35     P submitted that $6,000 be awarded for post-traumatic benign positional vertigo, based on the _Guidelines_, which posit that $1,000–$6,000 be awarded for minor head injuries.[^19] D submitted that, in any event, no more than $500 should be awarded given that P appeared to have largely recovered within 3 months, with no further treatment needed and no long-term disability being expected.[^20]

36     I awarded $2,000 in damages.

37     I agreed with the essence of D’s argument, _ie_, that P had been treated conservatively, and did not follow up with treatment past 20 Jan 2017 (_ie_, nearly 6½ months post-accident) after having “improved significantly” in Dr Ho’s words. Dr Ho also did not expect any long-term disabilities. I also thought that P did not give a satisfactory reply when questioned why she consulted Dr Ho for her vertigo 3.5 months post-accident, instead of following up with Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) (where she had first received treatment, and continued to do so for her orodental injuries). This led me to infer that the vertigo must have been tolerable enough such that it did not demand medical attention for that amount of time.

### Hip/Leg injuries

38     P was diagnosed by Dr Chang, an orthopaedic specialist in private practice, with a hip contusion, an osteochondral fracture of the femoral head (with risk of post-traumatic arthritis to the hip joint); and a left knee contusion.

#### Causation

39     I found, contrary to D’s arguments,[^21] that the accident had caused these injuries.

40      **_First_**, Dr Chang was not cross-examined on his view that the accident caused the knee contusion and hip injuries.

41      **_Second_**, the knee contusion and hip injuries appeared consistent with the posited mechanism of the accident.[^22] D seems to accept[^23] Dr Chang’s hypothesis that the injuries were caused when the left knee hit the back of the taxi’s front seat and transmitted the force of the impact to the hip via the femur. Dr Chang also ruled out degenerative cartilage loss as, _generally_, P had not reached an age where degenerative and age-related cartilage loss was expected and, _specifically_, the arthroscopy revealed that the rest of the uninjured hip was “pristine”.

42      **_Third_**, there were contemporaneous records of these injuries in some sense. As early as 17 Jun 2016 (_ie_, 8 days post-accident), CGH gave P a referral to the orthopaedic department.[^24] I found this consistent with P’s explanation in cross-examination, _ie_, that she had asked for a referral to CGH orthopaedic department for the hip pain but was told that she had to wait 6 months. Also, both Dr Chang’s reports noted that D was given analgesics for left knee pain. These points were simply not explored further in evidence. Even if it was Dr Chang who first documented these injuries (_ie_, 1 month post-accident), I would have found the complaints contemporaneous enough to exclude with more confidence the hypothesis that the hip injury was sustained post-accident. While D argued that the knee contusion was not documented in the CGH medical report, that was only to be expected since that report was issued by a dental officer of the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, and would naturally have focused on her orodental injuries. In this regard, Dr Chang’s unchallenged evidence was that the dental surgeon would not know anything beyond the mouth.[^25] Likewise, although the CT Scan only suggested that the clinical diagnosis was “head and face injury”,[^26] this was simply to confirm a preliminary diagnosis given when the CT scan was ordered in the first place.[^27] I did not accept D’s argument that the knee contusion was an injury which a doctor could pick up from a physical examination without needing P to call his/her attention to it. Common experience tells us that bruises do not always appear immediately after the accident. More importantly, Dr Chang’s explanation (which I accepted as persuasive and unchallenged) was that this was relative: at the emergency department, given that P presented with rather severe orodental injuries, a bruised knee would not have mattered at that time.[^28] Similarly, the hip pain might not have been at the forefront of P’s mind at that time.

#### Quantum of award

43     P reported that her knee pain arose from the accident and settled about a week later. However, she developed persistent pain in the left thigh and hip. This entailed chronic dull pain in the upper left thigh and groin, aggravated by left hip movement. Her right hip movement was slightly restricted, and she had pain in the right groin with an internal rotation of the hip in a flexed position. An MRI of the left hip showed joint effusion and bone oedema of the femoral head extending to the subchondral bone; narrowing of the superior joint space due to cartilage thinning/loss; minimal depression of the femoral head outline; and (what appeared to be) a tear of the anterior acetabular labrum. Dr Chang thus diagnosed P with a left hip contusion with articular cartilage injury to the femoral head (_ie_, a small focus of bone depression of the left femoral head with cartilage loss) and an anterior labral tear.

44     She was medicated with anti-inflammatory medication and given joint supplements. In at least 5 reviews over the next 12 months, the hip pain persisted and was aggravated by walking/standing for long periods (as the labral tear caused painful femoroacetabular impingement) and extremes of motion.

45     A repeat MRI in Feb 2017 (_ie_, 8 months post-accident) showed interval resolution of bone oedema in the femoral head with joint effusion, tiny fragmentation of the anterior labrum (possibly comparable with the tear seen in the earlier MRI), and reduced hip space from cartilage loss. She was recommended to undergo, and in Jul 2017 was admitted for, arthroscopy under general anaesthesia. The arthroscopy revealed inflammatory synovitis; a healed osteochondral injury to the femoral head (of 1.5cm diameter) and partial thickness (grade 2) wear of articular cartilage; and a small loose chondral body. However, the labrum was intact: while Dr Chang seemed to waver on this point, he eventually concluded that it was more likely to be a false positive MRI finding than an indication that the labrum tear had healed, given that there was a loose chondral body which could also explain the pain and which the MRI did not detect. Dr Chang removed that loose body, and resected a bony lump on the edge of the femoral head. P was discharged 2 days later, ambulant and partial weight-bearing with crutches (which were to be used for 3 weeks). After the sutures were removed (when the arthroscopic portals had healed), she walked normally with nearly full range of hip motion and minimal pain. She was prescribed a joint supplement for 2 years, and could not do strenuous weight-bearing activities but was advised to do regular exercise to maintain hip strength and flexibility.

46     Dr Chang said these injuries made P predisposed to post-traumatic hip osteoarthritis. He thought it might supervene in 8–10 years’ time from Sep 2017 as hip pain and stiffness. For mild to moderate arthritis she would require medication, and it was more likely than not that she might require a total hip replacement in the future. This, however, might be delayed with supplements.[^29]

47     P submitted in closing that $3,000 be awarded for the left knee contusion (based on the _Guidelines_, which posit at Chap 7, para B(c) that $1,500–$5,000 be awarded for minor knee injuries), that $25,000 be awarded for the hip contusion and osteochondral fracture of the femoral head (being a severe hip/pelvis injury), and a further $8,000 for what is in substance a risk of osteoarthritis to the hip.[^30]

48     D submitted that, in any event, no more than $500 and $10,000 should be awarded for the knee contusion and hip injury, given that the hip injury would be a “moderate” pelvis or hip injury within the _Guidelines_ (for which a range of $8,000–$18,000 is posited at Chap 6, para J(b)),[^31] that the plaintiff had not proven on a balance of probabilities that there had been a labrum tear,[^32] and that any award for (the risk of) osteoarthritis was being separately considered. As for the (risk of) osteoarthritis, a further $3,500 might be awarded, reasoning from the award of $3,500 in _Ful Bar Rahman Shafir Uddin Akonda v Sim Hai Seng (formerly trading as Chang Joo Construction)_ (DC Suit 509/2011), where the plaintiff had a longer life expectancy and suffer for a longer time (such that the award should be reduced here) but where the decision was older (such that the award should be increased).[^33]

49     I awarded damages as follows:

> (a)     $15,000 for the hip fracture;

> (b)     $3,500 in addition thereto for the risk of osteoarthritis; and

> (c)     $1,000 for the knee contusion.

50     I was hesitant to classify P’s pelvis/hip injuries as “severe”, since that contemplated a partial or total hip replacement surgery which was only partially successful, and where the claimant continues to suffer from significant disabilities. Instead, I thought that P fell rather neatly into the descriptors for “moderate” hip injuries, since she had achieved substantial recovery within 14 months with slight residual disabilities, and was likely to require hip replacement in the foreseeable future. While an award in the upper range would be appropriate where there is significant risk of osteoarthritis, it did not entirely follow that, where osteoarthritis is the subject of a separate award, the would-be award for the hip injury is reduced by that amount. This is because the risk of osteoarthritis is also at least slightly relevant as an indicator of how severe the injury (and the pain and suffering) was. Taking inflation into account, I awarded $15,000 for the hip fracture. To be sure, I did not consider the supposed labrum tear to be critical, since I was ultimately awarding general damages for pain and suffering rather than for a specific diagnosis. In my judgment, the pain arising from impingement caused by the loose chondral body would have been comparable to that of a labrum tear; if at all, it should attract a larger award because the treatment required would have been more invasive (_ie_, removing the loose body by arthroscopy, as opposed to letting the labrum heal naturally). As for the risk of osteoarthritis, I agreed with D’s arguments. I did not see why P should be awarded damages at the top of the scale and, even then, inflation would not have justified increasing the award from $5,000 to $8,000. I thus awarded only $3,500.

51     As for the knee contusion, it had settled in about a week by the plaintiff’s own account. No particular treatment was sought for it. However, I noted that the force was severe enough such that it was transmitted to the other end of the femur and caused a bad hip contusion. I thus awarded $1,000.

### Totality principle

52     In my view, the total award of $53,000 for pain and suffering fairly reflected P’s overall pain and suffering, and I did not think she would be under- or over-compensated.

## Medical treatment-related losses

### Pre-AD medical expenses

53     In substance, P claimed $54,788.98 for pre-AD medical expenses.

54     I awarded $53,876.80, on account of D succeeding partially on the latter of the 2 main arguments he raised.

#### Effect of insurance

55     I did not accept D’s argument that, of this claim, $35,810.99 was no longer claimable as P had claimed such an amount through her own insurance plan.

56     It is true that, generally, any award of damages, being compensatory, must consider any gain which the claimant would not have enjoyed but for the wrong done. However, as P noted,[^34]_Koh Chin Hwee v Ang Dixon_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 84</span> at \[24\] _et seq_ recognised an exception where the claimant has recovered sums under an insurance policy for which he/she has paid the premiums. This appears to have been the case with P.

#### Consultation with private doctors/excessive medical treatment

57     D also argued that the award should at most be $33,425.66 in the first place, principally because P failed to mitigate her losses, in that she unreasonably chose to consult doctors in private practice rather than get a referral to CGH’s neurology/orthopaedic departments. Any damages for medical expenses incurred in a private hospital setting should be discounted by 50%, given that the final bill that a government hospital would have rendered should have been 50–60% less than that furnished by a private hospital.

58     I reduced the medical expenses by $912.18, being one-third of the medical expenses of $2,736.53 arising from consultation/treatment with Dr Ho (the _neurologist_ in private practice).

59     In my judgment, P was vindicated in her decision to consult an **_orthopaedic specialist_** in private practice. I rejected D’s submission that P had unreasonably chosen not to follow-up with CGH’s orthopaedic department on the pretext that the appointment would be in 6 months’ time because (i) her appointment was in fact only 4 months from the date of referral; and (ii) she underwent arthroscopy only in July 2017; and she unreasonably warded herself for an MRI scan because she had a bit of pain and because she wanted this expense to be claimable against the insurer. _First_, it was immaterial whether the appointment to see the CGH orthopaedic specialist was given for 4 months’ or 6 months’ time from the date of referral. The point was, it was reasonable for P to have considered the appointment to be too far in the future, given the pain and suffering she felt. Importantly, P’s first consultation with Dr Chang was only 1 month after the accident, and within about 3 weeks of having been given an appointment with the CGH orthopaedic department. _Next_, I did not hold against P the fact that she underwent arthroscopy only in July 2017 because this would have been the culmination of her consideration of Dr Chang’s advice. Given that arthroscopy is an invasive procedure, it was only reasonable for P to deliberate this matter. Neither P nor Dr Chang were given any fair opportunity to defend P’s decision to undergo arthroscopy only in Jul 2017. Further, I had hardly any basis to second-guess how P’s course of treatment might have turned out had she waited for treatment from the CGH orthopaedic department. _Finally_, I did not hold against P the fact that she was warded to undergo an MRI. There is no direct evidence before me on whether this is accepted medical practice, even if it did weigh on P’s mind (rightly or wrongly) that it would be a medical expense against which she would be personally insured should she be warded. The decision to ward a patient is _ex facie_ not one lightly made and I presumed that the doctors sanctioned it. Neither Dr Chang nor Dr Ho were cross-examined on the circumstances surrounding P’s admission for the purpose of the MRIs.

60     However, I was not satisfied that P’s choice to visit a **_neurologist_** in private practice was reasonable. I agreed with D that, as regards her neurological injuries, she could not explain why she had consulted a private neurologist instead of following up with the CGH neurology department, save that someone recommended her to Dr Ho. Being recommended by somebody was, in my judgment, slightly too vague and convenient a reason for consulting a private neurologist over the CGH neurologist. P did not appear to have taken any intermediate steps (_eg_, serious attempts to get an appointment with a neurologist at a government hospital, or attempt to seek generalist outpatient treatment).

61     While I accepted generally that a discount should be applied since the cost of treatment in a private hospital setting differs from that in a government hospital setting, the applicable discount was harder to decide. I was not inclined (as D tried to persuade me) to apply a 50% discount as was done in _AOD v AOE_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 272</span> at \[44\] and \[46\], given that such price differences were a matter of fact rather than of law. The only evidence before me in this regard was the differences in the prevailing rates for a hip replacement surgery. That was not the best evidence, as the price disparities may also differ depending on the treatments. Since D had the burden to prove the extent of loss that could have been reasonably avoided, I resolved the vagaries of such a comparison against him. In the circumstances, I considered a one-third discount to be reasonable.

### Transport expenses

62     P claimed $1,230.00 in transport expenses for 41 trips to the hospitals at an estimated $30 per round trip.

63     D submitted that I should award only $740.00 for 37 trips to CGH at an estimated $20 per round trip, plus $390 for 13 trips to Dr Chang’s/Dr Ho’s clinics at an estimated $30 per round trip.

64     I found D’s working assumptions to be more reasonable, in the absence of receipts supporting a higher figure, and considering that P stayed near CGH. I therefore awarded $1,130.

### Future medical expenses (“FME”)

#### Root canal reviews; joint supplements

65     Among other things, P had claimed, $8,400.00, for 6 monthly reviews on P’s root canal; and $1,680.00, being 2 years’ worth of supplements to promote recovery of articular cartilage of the femoral head.

66     I made no award on these claims.

67     The recommendations to undergo 6 monthly reviews and to take joint supplements were made in Jul 2017 and Sep 2017 respectively. In other words, I would have expected P to have long completed her monthly reviews, and be finishing any course of supplements soon (_ie_, Aug 2019). The latest bundle of documents, tendered in mid-Oct 2018, contained invoices for medical expenses as late as end-Aug 2018. If the reviews had been attended and joint supplements taken, they could and should have been claimed as special damages.

#### Hip replacement

68     Next, P claimed $46,800, being the expected cost of a total hip replacement in the future in a private hospital setting. She said that she would continue her treatment with Dr Chang, and submitted that this was normal and reasonable, and that P should be fully compensated as long as her choice was reasonable.

69     While D accepted Dr Chang’s opinion that P would more likely than not require a total hip replacement in the future, D submitted that only $6,198.20 be awarded, being the average 75th percentile cost of such a procedure in a C-class ward across the 5 government/restructured hospitals. D submitted that P could not claim for losses that could reasonably be mitigated, and P had not shown the necessity of having a hip replacement at a private hospital or at a public hospital B1 ward.

70     I awarded $6,660.00.

71     I saw little need for P to return to Dr Chang to perform the hip replacement. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, P eschewed treatment from CGH because she had to wait too long for an appointment. This reason, however, does not hold water here. Unlike P’s acute injuries, which justified urgent attention, the hip osteoarthritis was expected to supervene in only 8–10 years’ time as of 2017 (_ie_, 6–8 years’ time from now). Neither did P give any compelling reason for following up with Dr Chang, despite what would be a long lapse of time. I did not think that, by the time P requires a hip replacement, a government hospital doctor would be in a materially poorer position than Dr Chang in performing the procedure on account of familiarity with P as a patient. If P had wanted the additional comforts or conveniences of a private hospital setting, this was in my judgment neither stated nor justified adequately.

72     At the same time, mitigation did not require P to choose the least expensive option where there were a range of reasonable options. I considered it reasonable to apply the B2 ward rate, given that P appeared to have stayed in the B2 ward for previous admissions to CGH. As there was no evidence on the average or median cost of hip replacements, I based my award on the next best available evidence, _ie_, the average of the 25th and 75th percentile bills across the hospitals. This worked out to be $6,660.00.

#### Oro-dental treatment

73     Finally, P claimed $25,000.00 in opening, being the cost of the dental implants to replace #11, #21, #22 and #31, as estimated by Dr Lai (the dental surgeon) in Jul 2017. In this regard, Dr Lai clarified in Aug 2018 that the cost of the permanent implant prosthetic bridge for #11-P-#22 would cost $10,000; the implant crown #31 would cost $3,300, and the crown #12 with post-core would cost $1,300, excluding consultation, consumables and radiographs.

74     I awarded $21,000.00.

75     This award was generally complicated by the fact that some procedures had been carried out after these estimates and clarifications were given.

76     I did not reduce the award on account of Dr Lai’s clarification that the doctors had done the procedure for the implant crown for #31 and some procedures preliminary to the permanent dental implants. These were performed in Dec 2018 and receipts for them were not in evidence.

77     However, I reduced the award from the claim of $25,000.00 by $4,000.00 because P claimed about $4,000 in respect of pre-AD expenses on oro-dental treatment since Jul 2017. D in substance argued that P should receive only $14,300, since she had failed to prove her claim in respect of $10,400 (_ie_, the remainder of the $25,000 not accounted for by Dr Lai’s Aug 2018 clarification) since she continued to go for treatment at CGH since Dr Lai first gave his estimate.[^35] Crucially, however, D did not adequately establish that Dr Lai’s original estimate should be revised downwards, and I was far from satisfied that the $4,000 spent on dental treatment after Jul 2017 accounted for all the ancillary dental treatment that had been effectively estimated to require $10,400. Neither did P establish that the $4,000.00 spent was separate from and not contemplated in the estimate of $25,000.

## Loss of future earnings (“LFE”)/Loss of earning capacity (“LEC”)

78     P, who is a newly-minted and essentially self-employed beautician by trade, sought $20,000 as damages for LFE/LEC in opening, but revised this in closing submission to a claim of $30,000 for LEC.

79     However, I made no award for LEC.

80     I agreed with D that both cumulative requirements of an LEC claim—that the injuries caused P a real or substantial risk of having to give up her business prematurely, and that P would therefore be disadvantaged in the open employment market were she to seek another job—were not met.

81     As regards the **_first_** requirement, P testified as follows. P operated the salon by herself, and would usually start work around 10.00–10.30am, and end around 7.00–10.00pm on weekdays and by 6.00pm on Saturdays. Apart from tending to walk-in customers for skincare retail, she would perform facials for 4–5 clients per day. According to P, each facial would last 70–130 min, during which P had to stand for 60–70% of the time to optimise the use of her equipment. Depending on the client, an appointment might involve, for example, 30 min of cleansing, 10–15 min of steaming, 20 min of treatment, massage, and mask. Dr Chang, having reviewed P for over a year, noted that she would always have difficulty standing and walking for long periods to treat her clients on account of her hip pain, even though she had improved after arthroscopic surgery and was expected to be able to attend to her clients more efficiently. P thus concluded that, if the pain worsened and she found it difficult to perform her present work, she might have to give it up and seek alternative forms of work.

82     In my judgment, P—by her own testimony—was not materially hindered in her work. _First_, P deposed that her hip pain “is not constant but … occurs periodically”. _Next_, she could sit for 30–40% of the treatment given to her clients, and she said that she could afford 15-minute breaks between clients on a usual day. _Third_, P did not state clearly what the business that she forwent as a result of the accident—for example, the volume of customers she had to turn away because her injuries would not permit a more rigorous work schedule. In fact, it seemed to me that, despite her injuries, P was operating at capacity. _Finally_, it seemed to me a remote possibility that P’s pain might worsen in the near future to the point that she had to give up her business. And, when her hip pain becomes too much to bear, she would could undergo the hip replacement surgery, for which she has been compensated in advance.

83     Speaking more generally, I found this case to be rather different from _Wong Kim Lan v Christie Kolandasamy_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 234</span>. The plaintiff there was a jewellery designer who, because of her injuries, could no longer bend for hours to select diamonds for design manufacture, or sit and concentrate for long periods. Instead, her design concentration was obstructed by neck pain, headaches and easy exhaustion. She was also unable to delegate her design work (because she would still have to supervise and edit the designs) or her deliveries (because, when she did so, she fell victim to dishonest employees). The judge there appeared to accept that the jewellery design industry was a competitive one as well. I was unable to say the same of this industry based on the material before me.

84     As regards the **_second_** requirement, I broadly agreed with D that P did not furnish credible evidence that she would be disadvantaged in obtaining a similar job with similar remuneration, or even a different job with similar remuneration. P’s present earnings had been fluctuating and, if anything, had increased after the accident—even on P’s best case, her profit (including salary) was only $26,000 per annum. Before P became a beautician, she had been in two sales/marketing positions for a total of nearly 17 years. While her salary while in those positions was not in evidence, I would be surprised if her salary there was less than what she was earning now.

## Conclusion

85     Accordingly, I assessed damages at, and entered final judgment in the sum of, $135,666.80, as follows:

> (a)     General damages for pain and suffering:

>> (i)       Facial lacerations: $4,500.00;

>> (ii)       Oro-dental injuries: $27,000.00;

>> (iii)       Head injuries: $2,000.00; and

>> (iv)       Hip/leg injuries: $15,000.00 for the hip fracture; $3,500.00 in addition thereto for the risk of osteoarthritis; and $1,000.00 for the knee contusion;

> (b)     Treatment-related expenses:

>> (i)       Pre-AD medical expenses: $53,876.80;

>> (ii)       Transport expenses: $1,130.00

>> (iii)       FME: $6,660.00 for the hip replacement; and $21,000.00 for oro-dental treatment.

86     I awarded interest at 5.33% per annum:

> (a)     on general damages of $53,000.00, from the date of writ to the date of judgment; and

> (b)     on each medical and transport expense (totalling $55,006.80), from the date of writ or the date of incurrence (whichever was later) to the date of judgment.

87     After hearing parties, I fixed costs of the action at $18,000.00, plus disbursements to be taxed if not agreed. Apart from the quantum of the award and the novelty/complexity of the issues raised, I took into account the fact that judgment in default of appearance had been entered, and that there were some 4 hours’ of hearings spread over 3 half-days in which evidence had been taken.

88     P has filed an appeal against my rulings on FME, LFE/LEC and costs. D has filed a cross-appeal against my ruling on FME.

89     I thank counsel for their assistance, and I commend counsel for D for pointing out that P’s claim for medical expenses was in fact larger than P had calculated it to be.

## Mechanism of payment

90     One final matter remains. D, just before filing its appeal, sought clarification of the judgment and further arguments before me on the mechanism of payment. Essentially, D submitted the judgment should contain a term to the effect that $35,810.99, being medical expenses that P had claimed against its own insurer, be deducted from the judgment sum and _paid directly to_ P’s insurers pursuant to reg 10 of the MediShield Life Scheme (Private Medical Insurance Scheme) Regulations 2015 (S 623 of 2015). D submitted that such a term would clarify the terms of payment, and allow D’s insurer to comply with reg 10.

91     I did not clarify my judgment as I thought my order, as it stood, was plain: that D had to pay P. What D was really seeking was a further order: D explained at the hearing that D’s insurer—who would be paying the judgment sum—and P’s insurer were the same entity. If this is true, what D sought in substance was for its insurer to _retain_ the sum which it had previously paid out under the policy P had with it.

92     Adding an order of this nature to the judgment might seem administratively convenient, but I made no such order. _First_, as P pointed out, this was an order that had never been pursued throughout the entire proceedings. I did not think it appropriate to allow D to seek such an order by way of further argument. _Second_, D did not satisfy me of the propriety of making such an order at this juncture. D had filed its cross-appeal, which included a line that might be taken to suggest that one ground of appeal was the fact that I had not given this order. I could accept that, generally speaking, a court may recall or vary its order if it is not perfected, even if there is an appeal pending. However, I was concerned that D was asking me to go beyond this by seeking, in further arguments, a fresh order, the absence of which might be interpreted as one of D’s grounds of appeal. _Third_, I did not see any factual basis for making such an order. I could only discern that P’s insurer was “NTUC Income”, but I could not be satisfied from the documents before me which entity it was, and whether it was the same as D’s insurer. _Fourth_, I did not see any legal basis for this order. Contrary to D’s submission, reg 10 imposes no obligation on D’s insurer. In fact, any obligation it imposes falls on P, and would arise on the date the payment is made by D to P. Accordingly, it would strictly speaking be premature for me to order D to pay P’s insurer directly.

93     Instead, I merely directed that P comply with any obligation which might be imposed on her under reg 10, as she should in any event. I also ordered D to pay P’s costs of this further hearing fixed at $550.
