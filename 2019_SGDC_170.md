3       Given the LT1 Conviction, the accused person was liable to be punished with _7 to 13 years’ imprisonment and 6 to 12 strokes of the cane_ for the present conviction.

4       After hearing the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s submissions on sentence, I imposed a sentence of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

5       The accused person appealed against the conviction only.

## THE AGREED FACTS

6       The Prosecution and the Defence had agreed to the following Statement of Agreed Facts (the “**SOAF**”)[^2] for the purpose of the trial:[^3]

> **I**.     **INTRODUCTION**

> 1    The Prosecution and the Defence hereby agree that:

>> (a)    The Accused is Adzhar bin Abdullah, a 45-year-old male Singaporean … (the “**Accused**”).

> **II**.     **ARREST**

> 2    On 28 September 2017, at about 7.25 a.m., a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”), attached to Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters, arrested the accused at Blk 553, Woodlands Drive 44, #XXX, Singapore. He was arrested for failing to report for urine tests, and subsequently was also suspected for drug consumption and drug possession

> **III**.     **CIRCUMSTANCES ARISING FROM THE ACCUSED’S ARREST**

> 3    Subsequently, the accused was escorted in a CNB operational vehicle (“**CNB van**”) to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. SSgt Mohammad Adli bin Mohamed Nawar (“**SSgt Adli**”), SSgt Amirul and SSSgt Saifuddin were the escorting officers who escorted the accused in the CNB van. At the void deck, the accused was escorted into the CNB van. He then exclaimed that he needed to urinate urgently, and said that if he was not escorted to the toilet, he would urinate in his pants. At that point in time, SI Lee Yong Sin instructed the escorting officers to bring the accused to Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre to urinate. The accused was thereafter escorted to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters for investigations.

> 4    At about 10:00am, the accused arrived at Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. He was escorted to CNB ‘E’ office located in Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. _At about 11.35am, at CNB ‘E’ office, the accused was offered water to drink and was asked to provide his urine samples._ This was witnessed by W/SSgt Siti Khadijah. However, the accused claimed that he was unable to provide his urine samples. He also refused to drink the water as he claimed that he was unable to drink the water. _A warning was administered to the accused under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“_**MDA**_”). The accused said that he was unable to urinate and maintained that he did not wish to drink water._

> 5    At about 1.00pm, the accused complained of stomach pain, and he was thereafter escorted to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital for a medical check-up at about 1.15 pm.

> 6    The accused was seen at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and was attended by Dr Loh Zhang Wei Max. In the medical report prepared by Dr Lin Yingcui Annette dated 14 October 2017, it was observed that the accused was not cooperative during the examination, and his urinary bladder was found not to be enlarged and his rectal examination was unremarkable. The accused refused water and food during his time in the hospital. X-Ray conducted on the accused showed that there is fecal loading in the large colon, for which fleet enema was administered. The accused managed to open his bowels but did not pass urine. A bladder scan was then conducted and it showed significant amount of urine in the urinary bladder.

> 7     _A further warning under s 31(2) of the MDA was administered at about 3.35pm. He was again warned at about 6.08pm under s 31(2) of the MDA. He was invited, at about 30 minute intervals, to drink water and to provide his urine samples from 6.08pm to 8.41pm, but the Accused still did not provide his urine samples._

> 8     _At about 10.45pm, the accused was escorted to the toilet to provide his urine sample, but he was still unable to do so._ At that time, SSgt Muhammad Ramzan noticed a wet bedsheet. The said bedsheet was thereafter seized and sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” with the serial number “BA0018537” and marked “D”.

> 9    On 28 September 2017, at about 11.29pm, the Accused was escorted back to Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters. _On 29 September 2017, at about 12.30am, the Accused was administered with a final warning under s 31(2) of the MDA by SSgt Amirul Asraf bin Abdul Aziz._ The Accused did not provide his urine samples and refused to drink anything. The Accused was later placed under arrest for an offence under s 31(2) of the MDA.

> 10    The arrest report dated 29 September 2017 filed by SSgt Adli is attached herein and marked “**Annex A**”.

> 11    The medical report prepared by Dr Lin Yingcui Annette dated 14 October 2017 is attached herein and marked “**Annex B**”.

> (Emphasis in _italics_ added.)

All definitions in the SOAF are adopted for these grounds of decision unless otherwise stated.

7       The following is an extract from Annex B (the “**Medical Report**”):[^4]

> \[The accused person\] was seen on 28 September 2017 at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. He was attended to by Dr Loh Zhang Wei Max.

> The patient was brought to the hospital by CNB officers as he claimed that he could not pass urine since same day morning. He had mild suprapubic pain, could not drink water because throat was dry and had not opened his bowels for 4 days. He claimed that he had taken 2 tablets of codeine and more than 10 tablets of diapzepam **daily**. Patient was not cooperative with the examination, urinary bladder was not enlarged and the rectal examination was unremarkable. _Patient refused to drink water or eat during his time in the hospital._ X-ray showed fecal loading in the large colon, for which fleet enema was administered. Patient managed to open his bowels following the fleet enema but did not pass urine. _The bladder scan showed significant amount of urine in the urinary bladder._ The accompanying CNB officers requested not to start patient on intravenous drip or have a urinary catheter inserted and requested for discharge instead. _Patient was discharged with the officials with an explanation that there was no medical cause found for the patient to be not passing urine._ A detailed discharge care advice was given.

> Impression: Retention of urine – cause unknown.

> (Emphasis in _italics_ added.)

> (Emphasis in **bold** reflects an amendment to the Medical Report by way of a letter dated 12 October 2018 from Dr Lin Yingcui Annette (“**Dr Annette**”) to Muhammad Izkandar bin Su’arli, the investigation officer (the “**IO**”).)

## THE DISPUTED ISSUES

8       The relevant provision from the MDA was as follows:

> **Urine tests**

> 31\. –(1)    Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(_b_), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.

> (2)    A person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as may be required by any of the officers referred to in subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.

9       The key elements of an offence under section 31(2) of the MDA, which were not disputed by the Prosecution and the Defence,[^5] were as follows:

> (a)     A CNB officer who required the accused person to provide a urine specimen held the rank of sergeant and above;

> (b)     The said CNB officer reasonably suspected the accused to have committed an offence of consuming a controlled drug when he required the accused person to furnish a urine specimen (“**Issue B**”);

> (c)     The accused person failed to provide his urine specimen within such time as required by the said CNB officer; and

> (d)     The accused person did not have a reasonable excuse not to provide his urine specimen (“**Issue D**”).

10     The disputed elements of the Charge in the present case are only Issue B and Issue D.

11     In relation to Issue D, the accused person bears the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide his urine specimen.[^6]

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

## The arrest of the accused person

14     SI Tan, SI Lee, SSgt Adli, SSgt Amirul and SSgt Siti were part of a team of CNB officers (the “**Raiding Party**”) which carried out a CNB enforcement operation on 28 September 2017 (the “**CNB Operation**”) that involved multiple raids at various locations, including the accused person’s flat (the “**Flat**”).[^8] The Raiding Party had raided the Flat to look for the accused person as he had failed to report for his routine urine test for quite some time.[^9]

15     When the Raiding Party arrived at the Flat at about 7:25 am, the accused person was sleeping. Upon waking up the accused person, SI Lee, in the presence of SI Tan, asked the accused person if he had consumed any controlled drugs and he replied that he had last consumed _Ice_, the street-name for _Methamphetamine_, 2 days’ earlier:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of SI Lee** [^10]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What else did he say?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So I asked him, uh, “What did you---why didn’t you come for your urine test?” He said he got MC---MCs to cover for his absence. Then I asked him, uh, “Is the MC fully covered?” then he said, “Yes.” So next I asked him, “Do you take any controlled drugs?” So he replied me, “Ice”. And I asked him, “How long ago? What’s the last time you consume?” he said, “2 days ago.”

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What language did he use when he told you this information?

 |
| 

A

 | 

English, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What did you understand as “Ice”?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, Ice is a term for methamphetamine which is a controlled drug.

 |
| 

**Examination-in-chief of SI Tan[^11]**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Did \[the accused person\] say anything else to you during the arrest?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, upon searching the, um, evidence in the bedroom, um, \[SI Lee\] questioned him on some certain questions that, um, if I can recall, he asked him whether, “Did you take any controlled drugs?” Then---and he replied, “Yes, 2 days ago, smoking ice.”

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

… Where were you when \[SI Lee\] questioned him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I was beside the accused person.

 |

  
  

16     The Raiding Party also recovered and seized the following items from the Flat (collectively, the “**Tablets**”) which the accused person admitted to ownership:[^12]

> a.     4 packets of 160 unknown yellow pills; and

> b.     6 tablets of white _Epam_ tablets in blister pack.

17     However, nothing turned on the seizure of the Tablets in the course of the trial and it had no bearing on the Charge.

18     The accused person’s admissions to the consumption of _Ice_ and ownership of the Tablets were recorded in the CNB field diary (the “**Field Diary**”)[^13] by SSgt Siti shortly thereafter in small font on the right side of the Field Diary:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image1.png)

19     SI Lee and SSgt Siti explained why the accused person’s admissions were recorded in the Field Diary in such a fashion:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of SI Lee** [^14]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Witness, I would just like to refer you to this field diary. There are several questions. Firstly, if you look at the 1st page of the field diary. At the entry 7:25 am, do you confirm that this is the entry pertaining to the arrest of the accused in this case.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

There were some writings in smaller font at the side of this entry where it detailed what you informed the accused and what he reco---and what was recovered. Can you please tell this Court why this was recorded in this manner?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, I thought I recorded the---record down when I asked the accused, uh, these questions that when did he smoke Ice. Uh, after that, then I realised that I took over the field book. I saw “Eh? How come it was not recorded down.” So I reminded the recorder to record down because this is an important evidence.

 |
| 

**Examination-in-chief of SSgt Siti** [^15]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you please, tell this Court who filled this up?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I was the one who insert this, uh, sentence over at this paragraph, this area.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Can you please, tell this Court why did you insert this paragraph?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. Uh, we went to the house, I was not---as in, I went to---inside to the house, but after they managed to arrest him, I le---left the---the room. Because there is female in---I mean, there is other female occupants in the house, so I have to go to attend to them. So, the book was with me. So, um, I didn’t manage to write at the point time. Only later SI ‘Leslie’ informed me about it, and also to, um---informed me to write it down inside the book. That is why---because bef---after that, already we continued with the 2nd house already. There’s no space, that’s why I write it at the side.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And when did SI ‘Leslie’ let you know about the information?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Around the 2nd house. The---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Around the---

 |
| 

A

 | 

after---after I write the “Visit block 409 Sembawang”.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So---so, it would be correct that the entry 0756 was filled in before you filled in this paragraph?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, correct.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And you just said that you filled in this paragraph at around the time where you all visited or---

 |
| 

A

 | 

As in after I filled up---because when---when we reached the vicinity already I filled up “visited block”, as in I write that and, uh---the---the word “visited block 409”. Yah. So, when we reached them, I will just put the time, but after putting the time, then S---uh, then later but SI ‘Leslie’ informed me about the accused PG to uh---ice for the first subject.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, just for the clarity of the evidence, would it be correct for us to say that the paragraph starting with “SI ‘Leslie’” and ending with “blister pack” was filled in at or about the time 0756?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes, correct.

 |

  
  

20     The accused person’s arrest was documented in a police report dated 28 September 2017 at 10:39 am,[^16] which was updated subsequently by way of a further police report dated 29 September 2017 at 1:36 am[^17] (collectively, the “**Arrest Report**”).

## The accused person requested to pass urine

21     After the accused person was arrested, the Raiding Party escorted him to a CNB operations vehicle (the “**Vehicle**”) at the carpark at the foot of Block 553 Woodlands Drive 44 (the “**Block**”). While inside the Vehicle, the accused person requested to pass urine urgently.[^18]

22     SOAF provided that the accused person had asked to pass urine while the Vehicle was still at the Block:

> 3    … At the void deck, the accused was escorted into the CNB van. He then exclaimed that he needed to urinate urgently, and said that if he was not escorted to the toilet, he would urinate in his pants. At that point in time, SI Lee Yong Sin instructed the escorting officers to bring the accused to Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre to urinate. The accused was thereafter escorted to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters for investigations.

23     With the exception of for SI Tan, who testified that the accused person had made the request while the Vehicle was still at the Block,[^19] SI Lee, SSgt Adli and SSgt Amirul all testified that the accused person had made the request after the Vehicle had left the Block for another location.[^20]

24     According to the Field Diary, the Raiding Party left the Flat at 7:37 am. At 7:55 am, the SSgt Adli, SSgt Amirul and SSSgt Saifuddin (the “**Escorting Party**”) escorted the accused person to Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre (“**Sembawang NPC**”) for him to pass urine.[^21] The Raiding Party arrived at the next location in the CNB Operation at 7:56 am.

25     The relevant extract from the Field Diary was as follows:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image2.png)

26     The Escorting Party did not procure the accused person’s urine sample at Sembawang NPC as they were supposed to do so only at their “own office”:

At Sembawang NPC, did you all procure a urine specimen from him?

No, Your Honour.

 | 

Is there a reason why you all didn’t procure the urine specimen?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_There were no urine bottles with us and even so, it is not our practice to procure, uh, uh, away from our own office toilet, Your Honour._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And in this case, your own office will refer to the toilet of which office?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Since, uh, there is a renovation in our own office, we are supposed to go to Tanglin CNB division for the processing of the accused. So, the toilet that I’m referring to is Tanglin CNB office toilet, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You said that there were no urine bottles with you at that point of time? Is it a practice that you all are---is there a practice for you to be carrying the urine bottles---

 |
| 

A

 | 

No---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

during a raid?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_Your Honour. It’s not our practice to carry the urine bottle._

27     After the accused person had passed urine at Sembawang NPC, the Escorting Party re-joined the Raiding Party and all of them eventually proceeded to the Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters (“**Tanglin HQ**”).[^23]

## The initial attempts to procure the accused person’s urine specimen

28     The first attempt by the CNB officers to procure the accused person’s urine specimen (“**Attempt 1**”) took place at Tanglin HQ, as described in paragraph 4 of the SOAF:

> 4    At about 10:00am, the accused arrived at Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. He was escorted to CNB ‘E’ office located in Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. At about 11.35am, at CNB ‘E’ office, the accused was offered water to drink and was asked to provide his urine samples. This was witnessed by W/SSgt Siti Khadijah. However, the accused claimed that he was unable to provide his urine samples. He also refused to drink the water as he claimed that he was unable to drink the water. A warning was administered to the accused under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”). The accused said that he was unable to urinate and maintained that he did not wish to drink water.

29     According to SSgt Adli, the accused person had requested for _Epam_ during Attempt 1 before “he will talk to CNB officers”.[^24] SSgt Siti had documented the accused person’s request in the Field Diary:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image3.png)

30     The accused person did not sign on the warning because he was “unable to sign”.[^25]

31     The second attempt to procure the accused person’s urine specimen (“**Attempt 2**”) took place at 12:05 pm when he was invited to drink water and provide his urine specimen. Again, the accused person refused.[^26]

32     The relevant extract from the Field Diary was as follows:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image4.png)

33     SSgt Adli testified that the accused person did not provide any reason for not drinking water and for not providing his urine specimen during Attempt 2:[^27]

>   
| 

Q

 | 

You indicated here that he refused to drink up. Did he provide any reason why he---he doesn’t want to drink?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour. He didn’t provide any reason.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And you further also indicated that he can’t provide his urine samples. Did he give you any reason why he was unable to provide the urine sample?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

## The accused person’s complaint that he was not feeling well

34     At about 1:00 pm, the accused person complained of stomach pain. As such, SI Lee instructed SSgt Ramzan, SSgt Adli and SSgt Amirul (the “**Hospital Party**”) to escort the accused person to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (“**KTPH**”) at about 1:15 pm.[^28]

35     The Hospital Party and the accused person arrived at KTPH at about 1:45 pm.[^29]

## The further attempts to procure the accused person’s urine specimen

36     The events at KTPH were briefly set out in the SOAF:

> 6    The accused was seen at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and was attended by Dr Loh Zhang Wei Max. In the medical report prepared by Dr Lin Yingcui Annette dated 14 October 2017, it was observed that the accused was not cooperative during the examination, and his urinary bladder was found not to be enlarged and his rectal examination was unremarkable. The accused refused water and food during his time in the hospital. X-Ray conducted on the accused showed that there is fecal loading in the large colon, for which fleet enema was administered. The accused managed to open his bowels but did not pass urine. A bladder scan was then conducted and it showed significant amount of urine in the urinary bladder.

37     From about 1:45 pm, when the accused person arrived at KTPH, to about 3:32 pm, no attempts to procure the accused person’s urine specimen as he was under medical observation. During this time, the accused person also did not request for any food or water.[^30]

38     At 3:32 pm, a nurse inserted medication into the accused person’s rectum to induce motion and, thereafter, at 3:35 pm, put on a diaper for the accused person. At about this time, a third attempt was made by SSgt Amirul, in the presence of SSgt Adli, to procure the accused person’s urine (“**Attempt 3**”). SSgt Amirul had also warned the accused person not to pass urine in the diaper and the accused person did not sign in the Field Diary to acknowledge Attempt 3.[^31]

39     Attempt 3 was documented in the Field Diary as follows:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image5.png)

40     After Attempt 3, the Hospital Party attempted to administer a warning to the accused person every 30 minutes until about 6:08 pm. However, no warming could be administered as the accused person was unresponsive and appeared to be sleeping despite attempts by the Hospital Party to wake him.[^32]

41     When the accused person eventually woke up at about 6:08 pm, the Hospital Party administered another warning and attempted to procure his urine specimen (“**Attempt 4**”). However, the accused person became aggressive and raised his voice at them. He claimed that he was unable to drink water and did not sign in the Field Diary to acknowledge the warning.[^33]

42     Attempt 4 was documented in the Field Diary as follows:

![]([2019] SGDC 0170_Image/[2019] SGDC 0170_image6.png)

43     The Hospital Party administered similar warnings to the accused person and attempted to procure his urine specimen at 6:38 pm (“**Attempt 5**”),[^34] 7:10 pm (“**Attempt 6**”),[^35] 7:40 pm (“**Attempt 7**”),[^36] 8:04 pm (“**Attempt 8**”)[^37] and 8:41 pm (“**Attempt 9**”),[^38] but the accused person was unresponsive and did not provide his urine sample. Details of Attempt 5 to Attempt 9 were documented in the Field Diary but the accused person did not sign in the Field Diary to acknowledge the warnings.

44     Attempt 5 to Attempt 9 were also mentioned in the SOAF:

> 7    … He was again warned at about 6.08 pm under s 31(2) of the MDA. He was invited, at about 30 minute intervals, to drink water and to provide his urine samples from 6.08 pm to 8.41 pm, but the Accused still did not provide his urine samples.

45     Between 8:50 pm and 10:00 pm, the accused person was sleeping and no warnings were administered to him despite attempts by the Hospital Party 30 minutes apart.[^39]

46     These futile attempts at warning the accused person and at procuring his urine specimen were not documented in the Field Diary:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of SSgt Amirul** [^40]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But no warnings were recorded despite him being unresponsive, similarly unresponsive.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. The---for the, uh, warning that was administered and I said that the accused didn’t respond to us, it’s when---when we administered the warning to the accused, Your Honour, he did had eye contact on us, so that he did listen to us administering the warning as such that’s why we pen down the warning that is being administered. For the instance of this where we attempt to wake him up but then he didn’t respond to us, he didn’t even open an eye to have a eye contact with us. As such, we couldn’t even administer to the warning to the said accused, Your Honour. As such, there was no warning we can administer and we didn’t---there’s no, uh, indication within this timeframe, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

47     At 10:45 pm, Dr Max examined the accused person and, together with the Hospital Party, helped the accused person off his bed onto a wheelchair and wheeled him to the toilet.[^41]

48     After the accused person was helped off his bed, the Hospital Party noticed a wet patch (the “**Stain**”) on the bedsheet that the accused person was lying on just moments earlier (the “**Bedsheet**”).[^42] SSgt Ramzan seized the Bedsheet and sent it to the Health Sciences Authority (the “**HSA**”) in a CNB tamper-proof bag bearing serial number “BA0018537” and marked “D” for analysis.[^43] The seizure was documented in a police report filed by SSgt Ramzan on 29 September 2017 at 12:54 am.[^44]

49     Dr Max also noticed the Stain and the seizure of the Bedsheet:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^45]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But what do you recall seeing, or at that point of time, when he was propped---propped up in his bed?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, so after he got out of bed, I noticed a wet patch on the bed sheet.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What happened next?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, as he was standing up, I---uh, the CNB officers actually, uh---uh, were in the process of removing the bed sheets.

 |

  
  

50     The accused person did not pass urine in the toilet eventually.[^46]

51     At 11:29 pm, the accused person was escorted from KTPH to Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters (“**AMK HQ**”).[^47] At about 11:55 pm, SSgt Amirul administered yet another warning and offered water to the accused person in an attempt to procure a urine specimen from the accused person (“**Attempt 10**”), but the accused person refused to drink any water and did not provide a urine sample. According to SSgt Amirul, the CNB officers continued to warn the accused person and try to procure his urine specimen even though more than 6 hours had transpired since Attempt 1 “just to give him a chance that if he’s able to provide then we’ll process his urine.”[^48]

52     At 12:30 am the next day (_ie._ 29 September 2017), SSgt Amirul administered a final warning to the accused person and attempted to procure his urine specimen (“**Attempt 11**” or the “**Final Warning**”). The accused person again failed to comply. In the circumstances, SSgt Amirul placed the accused person under arrest and informed him that he would be charged under section 31(2) of the MDA.[^49]

53     SSgt Adli filed a police report on 29 September 2017 at 1:27 am to document the arrest of the accused person for failing to provide his urine specimen for urine test under section 31(2) of the MDA.[^50]

## The medical evidence

54     Dr Max had attended to the accused person at KTPH and a summary of his observations and findings were set out in the Medical Report (_ie._ Annex B to the SOAF).

55     Dr Max provided further clarification during examination-in-chief on his observation of the accused person in KTPH:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^51]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

What was your observations of the patient when you first saw him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, so, when I first, uh, saw him, uh, he said that he couldn’t pass urine since 8:00 in the morning, uh, and this was, uh--- uh, not normal from him. So he---he said that his last e---uh, he last passed urine at 8:00 that morning. Um, he also said that he had not passed motion for about 3 days. Uh, he also said that he, uh, have, uh, some, a---abdominal pain as well. Uh, so, uh, when I examined him, um, his vital signs were actually, uh---uh---uh, quite normal, in a sense that he did not have a fever, his heart rate also not, uh, fast, uh, his blood pressure was in a normal range as well. Um, uh, when I examined him at the time, he---I---I noticed that he was, uh, on restraints, uh, and he was not really cooperative with, uh, examination as well. Uh, he was curled up and, uh, and, uh, when I tried to feel his, uh, abdomen, uh, he, um, refused to relax for me, yah. Uh, and I also did, uh, I also did a digital rectal examination which, uh, means that I, uh, took my finger up his rectum to check, uh, whether there’s anything, uh, that can cause the urinary, uh, causing not to be able to pass urine. So, uh, when I---when I did the rectal examination, uh, it was, uh, quite unremarkable in the sense that, um, that was, uh, no faeces, uh, in the rectum and, um, the prostate was not enlarged.

 |

  
  

56     Dr Max added that the accused person had complained of abdominal pain but Dr Max could not identify any other symptoms that shed light on the cause of the abdominal pain:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^52]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

During your examination, were there any indicators---sorry, firstly, this mild suprapubic pain, was it a condition that you have observed or was it a condition that was reported to you?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, so, it was a condition that was, uh, reported to me.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And who reported it to you?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, so, Mr. Adzhar.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

During your medical examination, did you find any cause for why he would have suffered from such suprapubic pain?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yah, um, so, in terms of, uh, suprapubic pain, uh, generally in the---could be a few causes. Uh---uh, in this context, because he’s not able to pass urine, uh, the first thing that, uh, I would think of would be, um, a urinary tract infection. Um, but, uh, there were no other indicators, uh, that pointed towards a urinary tract infection. So, if, um, usually when patients have urinary tract infection, they would also com--- uh, usually have fever, um, they may have some, uh, loin pain, so kidney pain at the back. Um, they may also complain of, uh---uh, pain on passing urine. Suprapubic pain that can be caused, uh, by, um, constipation, uh, which, um---I think later on an X-ray was done as well and showed some constipation as well. _Um, that---there could be more other serious causes of a suprapubic pain, uh, such as, um, uh, any, uh, organs in the abdomen that had an infection, but, uh, there was no indication that he---that this was the case as well, because, uh, as I mentioned previously, his temperature was normal. Uh, his, uh, heart rate and blood pressure were all within a normal range, and it was just a very localised, uh---he com---just complained of this suprapubic, uh, pain and no other---other symptoms._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, just for completeness of record, what are the various indicators for an infection?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, so, uh, clinically, uh, just, uh, so if the temperature would be raised, so there’ll be a fever. Uh, usually, uh, above 38 degrees. Um, the heart rate, uh, would---can be high as well. Uh, so usually more than hundred. The blood pressure, if it’s a very serious infection, it can be on the lower s---on---on the lower side, um, and, um, examination findings, uh, there would---um, the patient would usually be, uh---uh, if, uh, drowsy, um, and, uh, yah, that could---and---and depending on the cause of the in---uh, infection as well,

there could be---there will be other signs as well. Um, for example, I’m just giving an example, um, appendicitis, that would be, uh, clear pain on the right side, uh, and there’ll be certain signs that you can elicit it that points towards, uh, other causes of abdominal pain.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

_And you’re saying that there were no other indicators in this case, earlier on?_

 |
| 

A

 | 

_Yes, there were no other indicators, Sir._

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added.)

57     Dr Max also conducted other examinations on the accused person and found nothing of significance except for slight constipation:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^53]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And upon your examination of the abdomen, was there any significant findings?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, no. It was, uh, quite unremarkable. Uh, it was, uh, normal, uh.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When he recounted his urination at 8:00am, earlier on, did he complain of any pain, uh, when he urinated then?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No, he didn’t.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Were there any other complaints that he made during your examination of him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, yah, he also said that he could not, uh, his throat was dry and because of that, he could not drink, uh, water or eat. When I examined his, uh, throat, he was as---he was normal as well.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

From your examination, was there any obstruction that resulted in him being unable to drink or eat?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, so obstruction?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

To the throat.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Oh, okay. Uh, no, the---from my examination, I couldn’t find any cause.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

We’ll move on. After examining him, what were the treatment that you have given to him?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, so, uh, because the X-ray showed that there was, uh, some constipation. Uh, so, uh, I gave him a laxative which was, uh, fleet enema. So, this is, uh, a laxative given through the rectum, uh, and to help the, uh, stimulate the, uh, gut, uh, to help to pass, uh, motion.

 |

  
  

58     According to Dr Max, most people with constipation can still pass urine even though constipation is one of the most common conditions for a person not being able to pass urine.[^54] Having examined the accused person, Dr Max was unable to conclude that constipation had resulted in the accused person not being able to pass urine.[^55]

59     Furthermore, the accused person’s constipation was relieved after Dr Max administered Fleet Enema on the accused person which successfully resulted in the accused person passing motion. Thereafter, when Dr Max examined the accused person again, the accused person no longer complained of abdominal pain or discomfort. The accused person’s vital signs were also stable.[^56]

60     During the accused person’s stay at KTPH, Dr Max conducted 3 bladder scans for the accused person which disclosed increasing volumes of urine in his bladder:[^57]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Time</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Volume</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2:36 pm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">299 ml</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8:40 pm</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">475 ml</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10:59</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">512 ml</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

61     According to Dr Max, a volume of urine above 400 ml would be considered high:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of Dr Max** [^58]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And I---can you provide any comment as to what a normal bladder, on average, would hold comfortably?

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

a ballpark figure, of course. We are not---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, in the hospitals, I think, uh, we usually, uh---uh---uh, say that 400 mL and above is considered high, uh, and would require some sort of, uh, intervention.

 |

  
  

62     Dr Max was unable to identify any medical cause for the accused person not being able to pass urine:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^59]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

However, from your medical examination, was there any other indicators that indicate that there may be a medical cause?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, no. So, uh, from my examination, I, uh, had, uh---as I mentioned, I had ruled out other causes. As in clinically, he did not have a urine infection from the---my examination, and the clinical, uh, the---the vi---the---the---the heart rate temperature. Uh---uh, and for example, as I said as well, uh, a large prostate can cause, um, urine---not being able to pass urine and, uh, his prostate was not enlarged during that examination.

 |
| 

**Cross-examination of Dr Max** [^60]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

…your opinion is that you are unable to rule out any medical cause because that would be in particular to this accused person, correct? But today your evidence before the Court is different to say that based on your observation, you cannot identify any medical causes. So just to---to clarify that point?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So uh, I don’t think what I said to, uh, to Judge and what I wrote here is not compatible. ‘Cause based on my examination and observations, I could not identify medical cause, uh, but that is not to say that I---that---uh, that’s 100% certain that is no medical cause. So as I’ve said, uh, in my evidence juts now, um, that usually in this Court cases, we would proceed on for further investigations, uh, so, in further investigations may yield a medical cause but based on---in just my interactions and my observations at that point in time, I was not able to identify medical cause but _I can say for certain that that there is no medical cause._

## The analysis of the Stain

63     According to the SOAF, the Bedsheet that SSgt Ramzan seized was sent to the HSA for analysis:

> 8    At about 10.45 pm, the accused was escorted to the toilet to provide his urine sample, but he was still unable to do so. At that time, SSgt Muhammad Ramzan noticed a wet bedsheet. The said bedsheet was thereafter seized and sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” with serial number “BA0018537” and marked “D”.

64     Thereafter, SSgt Ramzan had sent the Bedsheet to the HSA for analysis.[^61] The HSA report dated 8 December 2017 (the “**HSA Report**”)[^62] confirmed that the HSA had received the Bedsheet in a CNB tamper-proof bag bearing serial number “BA0018537” and marked “D”, which matched the description in the SOAF.

65     The HSA Analyst from the Forensic Chemistry and Physics Laboratory of the HSA,[^63] extracted samples of the Stain (the “**Stain Samples**”) together with control samples of the Bedsheet (_ie._ parts of the Bedsheet other than the Stain) (the “**Control Samples**”) for analysis.

66     The analysis detected the presence of _Urea_ and _Creatinine_, both constituents of urine, as well as _Methamphetamine_ in the Stain Samples. However, _Tamm-Horsfall_ protein or _THP_, a substance produced in the kidney and one of the most abandoned proteins in urine, was not detected by the analysis.[^64]

67     According to the HSA Analyst, there were a number of reasons why _THP_ might not be detected even if a test sample contains urine:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the HSA Analyst[^65]**

 |
| 

A

 | 

…sometimes, um, components of urine may not be detected for other reasons. So, uh, I’d like to may be state here that not detecting something does not mean it's not there, it could just mean that it has fallen below our levels our detection. So, in this case if you---if you look at this bedsheet, um, it is relatively big compared to the kind of typical exhibits that examines, say like underwear or jeans if---if, uh, if it they---the question here in urine, so there is a chance that the urine may have spread over a very large area, hence decreasing the amount of THP that is localised in that area which would then reduce the amount that unable, uh, the amount and hence I’m not able to detect. So, another consideration that I have, uh, is that the bedsheet naturally, I think, would have to be mounted on a mattress or bed so, uh, I don’t think that if urine were to be passed on the bedsheet, it would retain only on the bedsheet itself and not sit (_sic_) through in the---into the bed, so, without examination of the bed, um, I would not be able to give a more---a conclusion with more certainty, and also um, I would like to add that THP being a protein is a relatively sensitive molecule, because proteins operate and only exits in a very narrow set of conditions, uh, much like for like, uh, much like our enzymes which they can only exist in a certain pH, assist in a certain pH, assist in a certain well-controlled environment, exist in a certain temperature. So, um, there are many reasons as per why I did not detect, uh, the protein in this case, but again I stress that, uh, there’s also the possibility that what I’m seeing may not be urine as well.

 |

  
  

68     The Control Samples that were subject to the same analysis as the Stain Samples were found to be absent of _Urea_, _Creatinine_ and _THP_.[^66]

## END OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

69     At the end of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence did not submit that there was no case to answer. On the evidence, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a case against the accused person and I called upon him to give evidence in his own defence. The accused person elected to do so on affirmation.[^67]

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

70     During examination-in-chief, aside from endorsing the entries in the Field Diary pertaining to the futile attempts by the CNB officers to procure his urine specimen, the accused person did not provide any reason why he was unable to pass urine while he was at Tanglin HQ and KTPH.

71     In fact, the accused person testified during cross-examination that he did not complain to Dr Max of any medical condition that prevented him from passing urine:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of Dr Max** [^68]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

…in the afternoon of 28th September, did you tell the doctor whether if you suffered from any medical condition that prevented you from urinating?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, prevented me, uh---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

That means stop you---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

from urinating?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Huh?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

That mean stopped you from urinating.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I only talked about my withdrawal, lah.

 |

  
  

72     The accused person’s assertion that he could not pass urine related to only the period after he was discharged from KTPH until the Final Warning was administered to him. However, no reason was furnished:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^69]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Now, can you see on \[the Field Diary\] there are---there’s a warning which was allegedly administered at 23:55…. Did you drink any cup of water which was provided to you at that point in time?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

….

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

_And you say you are unable to give your urine sample at that time, why?_

 |
|

73     The accused person was evasive during the DPP’s cross-examination but it was nevertheless clear that neither his alleged medical condition nor his purported withdrawal symptoms prevented him from passing urine:

Q

Okay, so but you can control your own urination? It’s not a case where you---so listen to me.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But this condition.

 |
| 

A

 | 

All this while.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

doesn’t stop you from urinating, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, urinating?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

That means---

 |
| 

A

 | 

You mean?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Not because like you have backache, therefore you cannot urinate?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_Uh, this one I cannot say, lah, because I don’t know._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yah, but---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Whether this---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

normally---

 |
| 

A

 | 

thing can---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

normally, you can urinate, right?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_I cannot answer you this one, because, you know, you---you say that this thing, uh, stop me from urinate, I cannot tell you what._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. So---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

did you---

 |
| 

A

 | 

_don’t know whether this thing stop me urinate or no, I don’t know._

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

… During \[Dr Max’s\] examination on 28 September 2017, will you agree with me that you did not any point of time complain to \[Dr Max\] that you could not pass urine?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And you agree with me if at any point of time you had a medical condition you could have ask for treatment from \[Dr Max\], correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I told \[Dr Max\] that I was having withdrawal symptoms for Epam. So they only checked my bladder and hat has the bladder got to do with my withdrawal symptoms?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Exactly. So if you had any issues with urinating you will agree that doc---you could have told \[Dr Max\] about it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I already told you \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

 |
| 

\[DPP\]:

 | 

Your Honour, the witness is now answering directly in English again I’m not certain what he is electing, whether if he’s electing to answer in English or---

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

I understand his simple English, uh, but the way he questioned is very confusing \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

… Why don’t you allow the Malay interpreter to interpret for you?

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Yes, yes. But when I talked to the Malay interpreter I say that (speaking in a different language) he---she asked me what is (speaking in a different language). I also don’t know how, she also don’t understand what is (speaking in a different language). Ah. \[as spoken by the Witness in English\].

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

The---so, Witness, the question was, at any point of time if you had a medical condition that stopped you from u---from passing urine you could have told \[Dr Max\], correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

Can I have the question again please?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

If you had any medical condition that stopped you from urinating you could have told \[Dr Max\]. I’m---I’m not certain how---how---how much simpler I can put this question.

 |
| 

A

 | 

When I came I told him that I had withdrawal, he---he ignored me. He ignored me but checked my bladder. I asked the CNB to send me to the hospital. Why did they send me there to check my bladder? I requested to go to IMH but the CNB send me to Khoo Teck Puat. I told s---CNB that I have just been discharged from IMH 2 weeks earlier and I wanted to go back to IMH. So how it---how would I know whether I have some urinating problem and whatsoever? Because I asked for a withdrawal---treatment for withdrawal. The doctor came the other day to give statement in Court and he said that he did not check, he did not cha---check me fully, Your Honour.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Adzhar, my question was very simple, it’s a yes or no question. Whether if you could---okay, Mr. Adzhar, you listen---

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

to the question first.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

My question was very simple was whether if you could tell Dr. Loh if you suffered from any medical condition but you went on to explain yourself. I will not belabour the point let me move on.

74     Therefore, the Defence’s case was primarily a smorgasbord of bare denials levied _against the Prosecution’s evidence_ rather than any specific assertion that he had a reasonable excuse not to provide a urine specimen.

75     The substantive elements of the defence could be distilled into, amongst others, the following main limbs:

> a.     The accused person denied that he admitted to SI Lee that he had consumed _Ice_ 2 days prior to his arrest.[^71]

> b.     The accused person admitted that he was asked to drink water and warned to provide his urine specimen in relation to Attempt 1, Attempt 2 and Attempt 3 but denied that he was asked to sign in the Field Diary for the warnings.[^72]

> c.     The accused person could not remember if he was asked to drink water and warned to provide his urine specimen in relation to Attempt 4, Attempt 5, Attempt 6 and Attempt 7 and Attempt 10.[^73]

> d.     The accused person did not give evidence in relation to whether he was asked to drink water and warned to provide his urine specimen in relation to Attempt 8, even though he recalled that a nurse had administered medication in his rectum at about 8:04 pm.[^74]

> e.     The accused person denied that he was asked to drink water and warned to provide his urine specimen in relation to Attempt 9[^75] and Attempt 11,[^76] the last of which was the subject-matter of the Charge.

> f.     The accused person claimed that he consumed _Epam_ and _Power_,[^77] and was suffering from withdrawal symptoms while he was at KTPH.[^78]

> g.     The accused person claimed that he was a motorcycle dispatch rider and only passed urine twice a day, once in the early morning before work and once in the evening after work.[^79]

> h.     The accused person claimed that the Stain was not caused by him and disclaimed any knowledge that the Hospital Party had seized the Bedsheet.[^80]

> i.     The accused person claimed that he wanted to provide his urine specimen when he met the IO

76     The Defence rested on the sole testimony of the accused person and the following statements provided by the accused person to the CNB:

> a.     Investigation statement under section 22 of the CPC recorded by SSgt Ramzan on 29 September 2017 at 12:50 am (the “**Long Statement**”).[^81]

> b.     Cautioned statement under section 23 of the CPC recorded by the IO on 29 September 2017 at 5:05 am (the “**Cautioned Statement**”).[^82]

77     Both the Long Statement and the Cautioned Statement were primarily exculpatory in relation to the Charge and the accused person admitted that he had voluntarily made both statements.

78     The following is the Cautioned Statement in its entirety:

> I do not wish to say anything to the charge. At the time of the arrest, I informed the officer that I wanted to urinate urgently. I was escorted to Sembawang NPC. I urinate at Sembawang NPC. After that, upon reaching CNB, I was then informed that they need my urine. I can’t urine since they did not take my urine the 1st place.

79     The accused person claimed that the Long Statement comprised a mixture of information provided by him and fabrication by SSgt Ramzan. In particular, the accused person denied that the following paragraphs in the Long Statement, amongst others, were given by him:

> 6.    After consuming the food and drink, I was warned by the officers again that I am not to urinate in the diaper and to inform them when I had the urge to urinate. I acknowledged it. The warnings continue but I still unable to provide my urine sample. However, I am still unable to provide my urine sample. Slightly later, I had the urge to clear everything in my stomach. I did not know whether it was stools or urine that I passed and I would like to say that I did inform the officers. That was the reason why my bedsheet was wet.

> 7.    Throughout my time at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, the escorting officers gave me several warnings that failing to provide my urine sample is a chargeable offence. They also offered drinks for me to hydrate however I refused as I am unable to drink due to the pain that I am having in my stomach area…

## ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE

80     The Deputy Public Prosecutor (the “**DPP**”) had called a total of 7 CNB officers of whom 6 (_ie. SI_ Tan, SI Lee, SSgt Adli, SSgt Amirul, SSgt Siti and SSgt Ramzan) were part of the Raiding Party, the Escorting Party and/or the Hospital Party.

81     Save for minor and non-material inconsistencies, their evidence as a whole was mutually corroborative and unshaken under rigorous, meticulous and, at times, robust and rigorous cross-examination by the Defence Counsel. They came across as truthful and forthright witnesses whom the accused person agreed had no reason to bear a grudge against him:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^83]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Were you personally---do you personally knew any of the officers that visited you that day?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I know some of the officer because they have---they are actually CNB officer from Ang Mo Kio and I do my reporting at Ang Mo Kio.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So other than reporting, do you have any other interactions with them?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So when you are outside, not reporting, did you ever bump into them? Did you have any other dealings with them outside of CNB?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you agree---will you agree that you do not have any bad blood with any of the officers?

 |
| 

A

 | 

No. Except for Leslie \[_ie._ SI Lee\] when I ask him for Epam. I told him that I could not urinate because I just urinated.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No. Perhaps, I will keep it simple what I meant by bad blood is do you have prior conflicts with them before you met them on 28th of September 2017?

 |
| 

A

 | 

On the day itself, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

On the day itself only. So your only dealings are on 28th of September 2017?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

82     The Field Diary also documented in detail the accused person’s arrest and the attempts by the CNB officers to procure the accused person’s urine specimen.

83     In contrast, I found the accused person to be a disingenuous witness whose kitchen-sink defence was random, opportunistic and came across as an afterthought. His overt confidence during examination-in-chief crumbled during cross-examination and he became evasive when answering the DPP’s questions and gave responses that were tentative or _non sequitur_.

84     The DPP also observed that even though the accused person did not require Malay interpretation and had no difficulty understanding and responding to the Defence Counsel’s questions _in English_ during examination-in-chief, he demonstrated an inability to comprehend even simple questions that the DPP asked him in English during cross-examination:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of the accused person** [^84]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Counsel, your-your client’s ability to under---to comprehend English seems to have deteriorated during Cross-Examination. Does he---you want to check with him whether he requires an interpreter to answer the questions of the Prosecution?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

85     Upon the accused person’s election, the cross-examination continued with the assistance of a Malay interpreter.[^85] However, the accused person’s selective linguistic proficiency soon became apparent as he responded instinctively and promptly to a number of the DPP’s questions _in English_ without Malay interpretation, for instance:[^86]

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of the accused person** [^87]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

… So if you had any issues with urinating you will agree that doc---you could have told Dr. Loh about it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I already told you \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

 |
| 

\[DPP\]

 | 

Your Honour, the witness is now answering directly in English again. I’m not certain what he is electing, whether if he’s electing to answer in English or---

 |
| 

Witness

 | 

I can---

 |
| 

\[DPP\]

 | 

Malay.

 |
| 

Witness

 | 

answer the simple English but sometimes I \[inaudible\] \[as spoken by Witness in English\].

 |

  
  

## The accused person’s admission that he had consumed _Ice_

86     The evidence of SI Tan, SI Lee, SSgt Adli and SSgt Siti were clear, unequivocal and consistent. They independently testified that, after the Raiding Party had awoken the accused person, SI Lee had asked the accused person whether he had consumed any drugs and the accused person had admitted that he consumed _Ice_ 2 days’ earlier.

87     Even though SSgt Siti did not immediately record the accused person’s admission in the Field Diary, she did so in the course of the CNB Operation after SI Lee reminded her.

88     Given the demands of a CNB enforcement operation and after hearing the testimonies of SI Lee and SSgt Siti, I was satisfied that the deferred recording of the accused person’s admission was justified and did not taint the overarching evidence of the CNB officers as a whole in relation to the events surrounding the arrest of the accused person at the Flat.

## The warnings to the accused person

89     The Prosecution’s witnesses testified that at least 11 warnings were administered to the accused person over a period of about 13 hours from 11:35 am on 28 September 2017 to 12:30 am on 29 September 2017.

90     According to the Hospital Party, no warning was administered to the accused person between 3:35 pm and 6:08 pm on 27 September 2017 because the accused person was asleep or not responsive. This was corroborated in part by the accused person’s evidence during examination-in-chief:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^88]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How do you know that at 15:35 you were sleeping, was that---

 |
| 

A

 | 

After they---they told me about this warning, uh, I straightaway shutdown.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Now, you say that you fell asleep, is that correct?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

91     The dates, times and locations of the warnings and the accused person’s evidence in relation to each of these warnings were as follows:

92     The consistent and coherent testimonies of the CNB officers, the concomitant records in the Field Diary and the accused person’s references in the Long Statement to warnings by the CNB officers, collectively militate against the bare denials of the accused person.

93     I was satisfied that there were no fewer than 11 warnings administered to the accused person over a period of at least 13 hours and the CNB officers had asked the accused person to sign in the Field Diary on each occasion, which the accused person had refused to do.

94     In any event, the central theme of the accused person’s defence was that he was unable to pass urine and it was clear that he was acutely aware of his obligation to provide his urine specimen to the CNB officers notwithstanding his varying degree of denials in relation to the warnings.

## Whether the accused person had any adverse medical condition

95     The Defence had produced no evidence to support the accused person’s assertion that he was labouring under withdrawal symptoms and that could not provide a urine specimen as a result.

96     Even though Dr Max testified that it was _possible_ for a person who took _Codeine_ and _Diazepam_ daily to suffer from withdrawal symptoms, Dr Max could not ascertain if the accused person was indeed suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the material time due to a dearth of information:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of Dr Max** [^89]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Given someone who takes according to his instructions to you, two tablets of codeine and more than ten tablets of diazepam a day, for someone of such characteristics of the build of the accused person, who has not taken these tablets on that day, is it possible for such a person to experience withdrawal symptoms?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, so---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes or no first.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I cannot comment. So, uh, can I elaborate?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, is it possible, first of all, for such a person to suffer from withdrawal symptoms? Because if you can’t comment, then I don’t see a purpose in you elaborating that.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay. Uh, I can’t comment, yah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, your answer is that, you cannot comment whether a person of such nature, of---of---of---who takes such amounts of drugs would suffer from withdrawal if you they do not have access to these drugs?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So, uh, yah, I can’t be certain for sure in his case, because, uh---uh, if I can elaborate, uh, each---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

_You can’t---okay, you can’t be certain, but is it possible?_

 |
| 

A

 | 

_Possible in the sense that, the he can get withdrawals---_

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

A

 | 

symptoms?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is it possible that he may have been experiencing withdrawals symptoms?

 |
| 

A

 | 

There could be a possibility depending on his time of the last dose.

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added.)

97     On the contrary, based on the accused person’s behaviour at KTPH, Dr Max opined that the accused person was unlikely to be suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the material time:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of Dr Max** [^90]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Now, you earlier mentioned that he was curled up, he was refusing to relax, he was, to certain extent, uncooperative, he could not lie flat on his back, his hands were clenched at times, and spontaneously open at times. Would all of these, on hindsight now, potentially be suggestive that there may have been a withdrawal?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, no. Uh, reason being is that, a---after that he was, uh, comfortable and not in distress. If the patient is in withdrawal, they will in fact, uh, get worsening symptoms.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

They will get?

 |
| 

A

 | 

They will get worsening symptoms. As in they will be clinically worse as the time goes on.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, your---your---you are---your evidence that you are certain that he was not having any withdrawal?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I can’t be certain but he was getting better.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, in your---

 |
| 

A

 | 

As in---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

opinion, it is possible, but you cannot be certain?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I---I can’t give percentage if you want me to be, uh, to say.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But is it possible, that’s my question.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Possible that?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

He may have been undergoing some kind of withdrawal?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Ah medically, I, uh, I can’t say 100%, but clinically, I would say very unlikely.

 |

  
  

98     In short, there was no medical reason for the accused person to be unable to pass urine and, thus, provide a urine specimen.

## Purpose of the intravenous drip and urinary catheter

99     The Defence Counsel had cross-examined SSgt Adli, SSgt Amirul, the IO and Dr Max extensively on the decision by the CNB officers not to start the accused person on an intravenous drip or insert a urinary catheter, although there was no evidence that such a decision had any bearing on the accused person’s ability to provide a urine specimen or the Charge.

100    In fact, Dr Max had testified that both procedures were not necessary in the present case:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of Dr Max** [^91]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

I will now move on to the last part of the medical report at \[the Medical Report\]. Which indicated that the accompanying CNB officers requested not to start patient on intravenous drip or have a urinary catheter inserted and requested for discharge instead. We will deal with both separately. Firstly, I would like to ask you, what is an intravenous drip?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Sir, intravenous drip, uh, is, um, uh, external, uh, fluids given through the veins, uh, into a patient, and this would involve, uh, putting, uh---uh, a plastic cannula into the patient’s veins, through the skin, and attaching the external fluids, um, through the plastic cannula.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

In this case from your examination, was there a medical necessity for him to be placed on IV drip?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, no. So, uh---uh, m---medically, uh, there’s no, uh, indication. So, usually intravenous drips are given when patients are dehydrated, uh, or, um, if their blood pressure is low, uh, on the need, uh, external, uh, fluids support. Uh, but in this case, uh, my assessment was that, he---Mr. Adzhar wasn’t, um, dehydrated and, uh, his blood pressure was within the normal range as well. So, uh, there was no medical indication for the intravenous drip.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Se---the second thing that was indicated in the medical report was the urinary catheter. It’s indicated in the report, the CNB officers requested not to have a urinary catheter inserted. Can you please tell this Court, what is the purpose of inserting a uri---urinary catheter?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, so, um, a urinary catheter, uh, is usually inserted when, uh, patients cannot pass urine, uh, mainly to, uh, relieve any discomfort. Uh, if they have any, uh, pain, uh, or, uh---uh---uh, discomfort or as well as to prevent, uh, any, uh---uh, damage or, uh, especially long term damage, because, um, if the urine is, uh, held for too long, uh, for too- --uh---uh, too long a period, it can cause kidney damage as well.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Similarly, in this case, is there a---from your examination, is there a medical necessity at any stage to insert this urinary catheter?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, so when I, uh, after giving him the fleet enema, uh, he actually passed, uh---uh, motion, uh, and subsequently when I examined him again, he did not, uh---uh, complain of anymore ab---uh, suprapubic or abdominal pain as well. Uh, he quite comfortable, uh, lying down. Um, so, I, uh, at that point of time, because there was no discomfort, uh, his, uh, vital signs were stable, so I, uh---uh, in that point of time, I thought that we could, uh, observe for a while longer, uh, to, um, to see if he can pass urine by himself. Uh, the reason being that, uh, a urinary catheter itself is an invasive procedure which, uh, contains, uh, risks itself. So, it’s not done without, um, uh, due consideration, uh, to balance the risks, uh, versus the benefits.

 |

  
  

101    Consequently, there was no evidence to support the Defence’s suggestion that the denial of either procedure had prejudiced the accused person’s ability to defend himself against the Charge was not borne out.[^92]

## The Long Statement

102    The accused person did not challenge the voluntariness of the Long Statement but alleged that certain parts of the Long Statement were fabricated by SSgt Ramzan and not his own words. As such, even though he had appended his signature on the Long Statement at various locations, he claimed that those were mere scribblings:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^93]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

1st, 2nd and the 3rd pages, do you see that?

 |
| 

A

 | 

yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is that your signature?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, this is not my signature.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

This is not your signature?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you remember signing this document though?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, I remember just like, you know, anyhow.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When you make that ha---motion with your hand---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Ah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

_are you saying that you just scribbled?_

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |

  
  

103    However, when the Defence Counsel brought the accused person through the Long Statement, the accused person appeared to have difficulty identifying specific parts of the Long Statement that were purportedly fabricated by SSgt Ramzan:

>   
| 

**Evidence-in-chief of the accused person[^94]**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, at paragraph 7 it says that, “Throughout my time in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, the escorting officers gave me several warnings that failing to provide my urine sample is a chargeable offence. They also offered drinks for me to hydrate. However, I refused as I’m unable to drink due to the pain that I am having in my stomach area. I do feel thirsty when I was there but I did not drink the cup of water that was offered by the officers, and only drank the cup that was given to me by the nurse.”

 |
| 

A

 | 

Ah.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Now, can you explain to us what---first of all, explain to us which is a---is the whole of paragraph 7 your words?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Okay, uh, the paragraph---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay, let’s break it down.

 |
| 

A

 | 

This---this---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Let’s break it down, okay? It says that several warnings was administered to you---were warnings administered to you, do you recall warnings being administered to you while you were in the hospital?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_I---I only recall like what I say just now, uh, but I cannot recall when, what time, I cannot remember._

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No. So, did you recall any warnings to provide a urine sample---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yes---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

being---

 |
| 

A

 | 

they are---

 |
| 

Q

 | 

administered---listen to the question first, Mr. Adzhar.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Were you---do you recall any warnings which were administered to you to provide your urine sample while you were in the hospital, yes or no?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

You remember that warnings were administered while you were in the hospital?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you remember drinks being offered to you to hydrate yourself?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, no.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you remember telling Officer Ramzan that you felt thirsty but you did not drink the cup of water that was offered by officers, and only drank the cup that was given to you by the nurse?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Sorry?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you remember---look at the statement in front of you, this is a statement---

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uhuh.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

right, that’s in front of you. Do you remember saying that you felt thirsty when you were in the hospital but you did not drink the cup of water that was offered by the officers, and only drank the cup that was given to you by the nurse?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Remember the thing that I drink from the nurse?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

No, first of all, do you remember whether---while you were in the hospital whether you felt thirsty?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Felt thir---yes.

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added.)

104    Furthermore, the Long Statement was substantively exculpatory in relation to the Charge, for example:

> 8.    I wished to say that I did not consumed any form of controlled drugs. I did not relapse back to smoking ‘Panas’ since my last offence in 2012. … I have never touched any other controlled drugs other than ‘Panas’ before in my life. I only consumed psychiatric medications which were prescribed to me by IMH. …

> …

> 10.    As for my absences from the Urine Supervision, I would like to admit that I did not report for it since 10 July 2017. However, I have MCs to cover for all of the absences. I have already passed it to my officer. That is all.

105    The accused person’s allegation of fabrication lacked granularity and particularity. Furthermore, it was inconceivable and no reason was offered by the Defence as to why SSgt Ramzan would fabricate only parts of the Long Statement when the Long Statement was exculpatory in nature and, on its own, did not advance the Prosecution’s case. Therefore, I was satisfied that the Long Statement was a true and correct statement given voluntarily by the accused person after he had been offered the opportunity to make corrections.

## The Stain on the Bedsheet

106    The Defence had submitted that no weight should be given to the Stain as there was no proof that it was caused by the accused person’s urine.

107    This submission was inconsistent with the accused person’s admission in the Long Statement that he had caused the Stain:

> 6.    … Slightly later, I had the urge to clear everything in my stomach. I did not know whether it was stools or urine that I passed and I would like to say that I did inform the officers. That was the reason why my bedsheet was wet.

108    The accused person’s evidence in court was also inconsistent with what he stated in the Long Statement:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^95]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

But if you refer to \[the Long Statement\], at paragraph 6, before that, did you know---at that point of time---sorry, in---during your time in the hospital, do you know whether if your bedsheet was wet?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_I did not know._

 |
| 

**Cross-examination of the accused person** [^96]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Is it your case that you have never---you---you did not wet the bed that day or in the hospital?

 |
| 

A

 | 

_I didn’t wet the bed on that day._ My shirt and my shorts were not wet.

 |

  
  

109    The Defence had also raised the possibilities of contamination or break in the chain of possession.[^97]

110    In this regard, the SOAF, which was agreed to by both the DPP and the Defence Counsel, stated:

> 8    At about 10:45 pm, the accused was escorted to the toilet to provide his urine sample, but he was still unable to do so. At that time, SSgt Muhammad Ramzan noticed a wet bedsheet. The said bedsheet was thereafter seized and sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” with serial number “BA0018537” and marked “D”.

111    Given the evidence of the Hospital Party, Dr Max and the HSA Analyst in relation to the discovery of the Stain, the seizure of the Bedsheet in a marked tamper-proof bag, the delivery of the Bedsheet to the HSA in the same marked tamper-proof bag and the process of extracting the Stain Samples for analysis, I was satisfied that the allegation of the Defence was without merit.

112    Therefore, I found that there was no basis for the accused person’s allegations against the integrity of the Stain and/or the Stain Samples.

## The accused person’s habit of passing urine only twice a day

113    Notwithstanding the bladder scans that disclosed urine in the accused person’s bladder, the accused person testified that he worked as a motorcycle dispatch rider for about 8 to 10 hours a day. As such, he seldom used the toilet.

114    During examination-in-chief, the accused person testified that he usually used the toilet before and after work:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person** [^98]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

In one day, how many times would you pass urine on average?

 |
| 

A

 | 

When I shower---when I shower.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And how many times a day do you shower?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Morning, one time when I wake up, uh, one time, uh, when I go back---go back home, uh, I will be taking a---a quick shower then I will pass urine.

 |

  
  

115    During cross-examination, the accused person clarified his usual working hours and the times that he usually passed urine:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of the accused person** [^99]

 |
| 

Witness

 | 

I work in a shift, Sir. I work from 3:00 to 11:00pm. Sometimes, I work from 10:00am to 10:00pm and---and there’s another one 10:00am to 8:00pm. And I don’t have a fixed shift, so it depends on them what shift that they want me to work.

 |

  
  

116    Given that the warnings to the accused person spanned about 13 hours from 11:35 am on 28 September 2017 to 12:30 am on 29 September 2017, and based on the accused person’s evidence that he would pass urine when he showered before and after work, by the time the Final Warning was administered to the accused person, it would have been long after the usual time that the accused person would have passed urine on a normal work day based on his usual working hours.[^100]

117    When this was asked of the accused person, he gave an incomprehensible response:[^101]

>   
| 

Witness

 | 

That’s what I said earlier, I couldn’t have possibly have with---try to withstand my urine that long. So, why didn’t they allow me to let the doctor examine---examine me fully? It can’t be possible that I can withstand that long not urinating. Like I said earlier, I was under withdrawal. I also informed the Court that I was---I went to IMH 2 weeks earlier before the arrest for Epam withdrawal at IMH.

 |

  
  

118    Therefore, I was not satisfied that his purported work and hygiene routine was an impediment to his ability to provide a urine specimen at the material time.

## The CNB general orders

119    During cross-examination, the defence counsel questioned SSgt Adli extensively on the purported CNB general order for a person to be administered with warnings every 30 minutes over a period of 6 hours before a decision is made to charge him for failing to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse.[^102]

120    However, there was no other evidence on the purport of the general order, the extent to which it applied to every case, the exceptions and the impact of non-compliance.

121    Furthermore, the warnings spanned about 13 hours and it was clear from the evidence of the Hospital Party that they had endeavoured to administer the warning to the accused person every 30 minutes except when the accused person was being medically examined or was unresponsive or sleeping.

122    There was also nothing to suggest that the accused person was not aware of the consequences of not giving his urine specimen and, as a result, had unwittingly passed urine without providing a urine specimen to the CNB officers.

123    Given the lack of information on the purported general order and the overwhelming evidence that the accused person was aware of his obligation to provide his urine specimen, nothing turned on this line of cross-examination by the defence counsel.

## Failure to obtain the accused person’s urine specimen at Sembawang NPC

124    I was satisfied with the reason given by SSgt Adli as to why the Escorting Party did not procure the accused person’s urine specimen at Sembawang NPC, _ie_ that the Escorting Party did not have the requisite urine bottles for doing so.[^103]

125    Given that an accused person’s urine specimen was usually the primary evidence against him for an offence of drug consumption under the MDA, it was reasonable for the CNB officers to procure the urine specimen only in a controlled environment and using the right and clean apparatus. The procurement of urine specimen on the fly may not only disrupt the CNB enforcement operations but may also engender issues of integrity of the urine specimen.

## The accused person asked to pass urine when he met the IO

126    The accused person testified that he had told the IO that he was ready to provide his urine specimen after he was brought to the Police Cantonment Complex (the “**PCC**”) from AMK HQ, just before the IO recorded the Cautioned Statement:

>   
| 

**Examination-in-chief of the accused person[^104]**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Was there any communication between you and the IO?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Ah, yes.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And what was that communication?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Uh, he bring me out, uh, he said, uh, I have to take medicine, lah, after this because the hospital give me some medicine, then I tell him, “Now, I can urine, how?” I said (speaking in a different language)---

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

“I told him that, “Now I can urine, so how?”

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And?

 |
| 

Adzhar:

 | 

Uh, he said (speaking in a different language) \[as spoken by witness in English\].

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

“No need, they have charged you”.

 |

  
  

127    This was disputed by the IO:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of the IO[^105]**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And when you came to see the accused person, my instructions are that the accused person told you at that time that he is willing to provide a urine sample. You can agree or disagree.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Disagree.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And your response to him was “That the decision has already been made to charge. Anything you want to say, you can go to Court and say”.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Disagree.

 |

  
  

128    The IO subsequently recorded the Cautioned Statement from the accused person in which the accused person made no mention of his willingness to provide a urine specimen at that point in time.

129    When the DPP confronted the accused person with the Cautioned Statement that made no mention of the accused person’s willingness to provide a urine specimen, the accused person offered no explanation and, subsequently, claimed that he could not understand the DPP’s assertion:

>   
| 

**Cross-examination of the accused person[^106]**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

…Then why did you not write that fact in this 3rd page \[of the Cautioned Statement\]?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So, when he told me that… when he told me that---he told---when he told me that they had already charged me, I was feeling down. This is all about feelings. So, when he said that I was shocked, why---why didn’t they take my urine? Why did they charge me?

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, you agree that---well, don’t you agree that at that point of time, you---you will want to write down whatever will help your case?

 |
| 

A

 | 

So, it is very easy, he can come up to the stand, I can go up to the stand and put us on the lie detectors to see who’s lying.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Do you have---

 |
| 

A

 | 

I already told him that I can urinate. So, he told me that they already charged me. That’s how we talk.

 |
| 

…

 | 

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Mr. Adzhar, I’m going to put it to you the fact that---the reason that the fact that you can provide urine specimen sometime at 5:00 am on 29th of September 2017 is not recorded in the Cautioned Statement. The only reason is because you did not tell the IO this fact.

 |
| 

A

 | 

It happened. It did happen.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

That the only reason why that fact was not included in this statement was because you did not tell the IO that you can urinate.

 |
| 

A

 | 

I don’t understand the question.

 |

  
  

130    In this regard, I found the IO to be a credible and candid witness who had no reason to prejudice the accused person in this respect. In contrast, instead of answering the DPP’s questions during cross-examination, the accused person had levied inexplicable allegations against the IO and failed to proffer any meaningful reason why he would exclude such an important fact in the Cautioned Statement, especially when the importance of such a statement was made known to him.

131    In this regard, I preferred the evidence of the IO and I was not persuaded that the accused person had told the IO that he was ready and willing to provide his urine specimen prior to the recording of the Cautioned Statement.

## CONCLUSION

132    The bedrock principle of our criminal justice system rests on the proposition that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. However, this does not mean that the Prosecution has to “dispel all conceivable doubts” insofar as any doubt for which “there is a reason that is, in turn, relatable to and supported by the evidence presented, must be excluded.”[^107]

133    In the present case, Issue B was not seriously disputed by the Defence and I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven Issue B beyond reasonable doubt given the reason behind the raid on the Flat to arrest the accused person.

134    The gravamen of the Defence’s case centred on the alleged lack of sufficiency of the Prosecution’s evidence to prove Issue D.

135    In this regard, I would first address the point raised by the Defence that the CNB officers should have seized the opportunity to take the accused person’s urine specimen when he asked to pass urine shortly after he was arrested. It was clear from the evidence of the CNB officers that the urine specimen could only be procured in a controlled environment in accordance with certain procedures. As such, the CNB officers could not procure the accused’s urine specimen at Sembawang NPC and had to escort him to Tanglin HQ for such purpose.

136    I found that the accused was not deprived of water and had, in fact, been given ample opportunity to consume water and provide his urine specimen from 28 September 2019 at 11:35 am until the Final Warning was administered, which was the subject matter of the Charge.

137    The accused person offered no explanation why he could not provide his urine specimen at the material time and failed to show that he had a reasonable excuse.

138    Dr Max had also testified that there was no medical reason for the accused person _not_ to be able to pass urine. In fact, the bladder scans conducted at KTPH disclosed that there was a not-insignificant quantity of urine in the accused person’s bladder.

139    Therefore, I was satisfied on the evidence that the Prosecution had proven the Charge against the accused person beyond reasonable doubt and I convicted him accordingly.

140    Even though there was no appeal against the sentence that I ordered, I would briefly point out that the minimum sentence prescribed in the present case was 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. In a typical case where an accused person pleaded guilty, the minimum sentence would be meted out on account of, amongst others, the accused person’s remorse.

141    In the present case, the accused person had challenged virtually every aspect of the Prosecution’s evidence even though some of these challenges were not seriously borne out by the accused person’s evidence or submissions. The entire trial lasted 7 days, excluding the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s closing submissions.

142    All considered, I decided that a sentence of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane would meet the justice of this case.
