### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Ahmad bin Sazali, male 37 years old, committed a total of 31 offences. He pleaded guilty to 16 charges, with the remaining 15 being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”).

2       The 16 charges he pleaded guilty to comprised:-

> (a)     four counts relating to thefts of motorcycles, punishable under s 379A (“s 379A”) of the Penal Code (“PC”);

> (b)     four counts of riding under disqualification, punishable under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”);

> (c)     two counts of riding without insurance coverage, punishable under s 3(1)(a) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks & Compensation) Act;

> (d)     three counts of exhibiting altered number plates, punishable under s 129(2)(d) of the RTA;

> (e)     one count of cheating to obtain possession of a motorcycle, punishable under s 420 of the PC;

> (f)     one count of unauthorised possession of 0.07 gram of methamphetamine under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), punishable under s 33(1) thereof; and

> (g)     one count of LT-1 drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, punishable under s 33(A)(1) thereof.

3       The TIC charges were in a similar vein. There was one further s 379A charge, three charges of riding under disqualification, five charges of riding without insurance coverage, one charge of exhibiting an altered number plate, and one charge each of drug possession and LT-1 drug consumption. There was also a charge each for mischief, failing to attend court, and failing to report to the police station while on bail.

4       The accused qualified for corrective training (“CT”). I was satisfied that it was expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should receive training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, and sentenced him to seven years’ CT.

5       In addition, the mandatory three strokes of the cane were imposed in relation to the LT-1 drug consumption charge. He was further disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles (“disqualified”) for a period of 12 years from the date of his release from prison.

6       The accused has filed an appeal against sentence. He has not been released on bail pending appeal.

## Statement of Facts

7       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification:-

STATEMENT OF FACTS

(incorporating 16 proceeded charges)

> 1.    The accused is one Ahmad Bin Sazali, a 37 year-old male Singapore citizen (NRIC No.: Sxxxx782H, D.O.B.: 30 March 1984).

> Facts relating to DAC 912159-2019 (3 Mar 2019); DAC 911668-2019 and DACs 912153-5 of 2019 (5 Apr 2019)

> 2.    The co-accused is Nur Arfani Binte Mohamed Sanie, a 28 year-old female Singapore citizen. She and the accused were friends.

> _Facts relating to DAC 912159-2019 (3 Mar 2019)_

> 3.    The complainant is Muhammad Raihan bin Edil Yasin. On 8 March 2019 at about 7.51 p.m., he lodged a police report at Nanyang NPC to state that his white Yamaha Spark T135 motorcycle bearing registration number FBC 5346E had gone missing from the open space carpark A along the Muslim Cemetery Path 4, Singapore (“the incident location”). He had last parked the motorcycle at the incident location on 3 March 2019 at about 8.30 p.m. The motorcycle had been valued at about $5,000 as of February 2019. The complainant also left two helmets valued at at least $70 hanging on the motorcycle.

> 4.    Investigations revealed that Arfani asked the accused for help stealing a motorcycle, because she wanted to use it as a means of transportation to visit her mother in the hospital. The accused agreed and suggested that they head to the incident location to do so because there were typically many motorcycles parked there and it was quiet.

> 5.    Sometime between 8.30 pm on 3 March 2019 and 12.45 pm on 8 March 2019, in the early morning, the accused and Arfani went to the incident location and saw the complainant’s motorcycle there. It was in the complainant’s possession at the material time. The accused and Arfani then formed the common intention to steal the complainant’s motorcycle. In furtherance of said common intention, the accused hotwired the motorcycle while Arfani kept a lookout. After the accused managed to start the motorcycle, he rode the motorcycle, with Arfani riding pillion, to Arfani’s residence at Blk 622 Bedok Reservoir Road, Singapore, and dropped her off. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 379A r/w s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”).

> 6.    Sometime during their journey, the accused cut the straps of the two helmets that the complainant had left hanging on the motorcycle and disposed of the said helmets.

> 7.    Thereafter, the accused affixed number plates with the registration number “FF21L” that Arfani had stolen to the complainant’s motorcycle. They did this in order to evade detection of their theft and allow them to ride the motorcycle on the roads. The accused also spray painted the motorcycle black to mask its original colour and dismantled the IU on the motorcycle. Arfani used the motorcycle for her own purposes for some time and the accused took it back in end-March 2019 to use for his own transportation.

> 8.    The motorcycle was eventually recovered on 11 April 2019 in its altered state.

> _Facts relating to DAC 911668-2019 and DACs 912153-5 of 2019 (5 Apr 2019)_

> 9.    The complainant is Muhammad Amirul Afiq bin Azmi. On 5 April 2019 at 9.25 p.m., he lodged a police report at Bedok North NPC to state that his white and red coloured Yamaha 125Z motorcycle FBA 8081J had gone missing from the carpark located at 706 Bedok North Road Reservoir Rise Singapore (“the incident location”). The complainant last parked the motorcycle at the incident location on 3 April 2019 at about 9.00 p.m. He had purchased the motorcycle for $500 sometime in 2016 and the Certificate of Entitlement cost $3,400.

> 10.    After the accused and Arfani stole the motorcycle in DAC 912159-2019, they decided to steal another one for Arfani to use. They visited the incident location sometime in the early morning of 5 April 2019 and saw the complainant’s motorcycle. They then formed the common intention to steal the complainant’s motorcycle. In furtherance of said common intention, Arfani pushed the motorcycle to a nearby park on the accused’s instructions. He met with her there and hotwired the complainant’s motorcycle whilst Arfani kept a lookout. Once the accused managed to start the engine, the accused rode the motorcycle back to his residence whilst Arfani left. He returned to his residence at about 4.53 a.m.

> 11.    Later on that morning, the accused sprayed the complainant’s motorcycle black to mask its original colour, removed the stickers from the motorcycle, and cut the IU unit cable. He also peeled off the number plate from the complainant’s motorcycle and fixed a forged number plate F1627E to its rear. He did this so that they could ride the motorcycle without being apprehended for their act of theft. The number plate was invalid.

> 12.    The complainant’s motorcycle was eventually recovered on the same day in its altered state. The complainant estimated that the cost of repairing the damage was about $400 - $500.

> 13.    Prior to the commission of the offence, the accused had been convicted on 23 November 2015 in District Court 9, vide DAC-928782-2015 and DAC-932136-2015 under s 379A PC as well as DAC-932135-2015 under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) and was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 5 years with effect from his date of release from prison, this being 13 August 2017 to 12 August 2022. These sentences have not been set aside to date.

> 14.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed four offences on 5 April 2020 as follows:

>> a)    The accused, together with Arfani and in furtherance of their common intention, committed theft of the motorcycle FBA 8081J which was in the complainant’s possession at the material time, and the accused has thereby committed an offence under s 379A r/w s 34 PC;

>> b)    The accused rode the motorcycle on 4 or 5 April 2019 while he was under disqualification, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 43(4) RTA;

>> c)    As the accused was under disqualification at the material time, he rode the complainant’s motorcycle while there was not in force in relation to him as the user of the said vehicle such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect to third-party risks, as complied with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (”MVA”), and he has thereby committed an offence under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) of the MVA;

>> d)    The accused exhibited a forged identification plate bearing the number F1627E upon the complainant’s motorcycle with intent to deceive, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 129(2)(d) RTA punishable under s 129(2)(iii) RTA.

> 15.    Arfani was charged for her role in the abovementioned offences. She was convicted on 3 February 2020.

> Facts relating to DAC-916514-2019 under s 8(a) p/u s 33(1) MDA (11 Apr 2019)

> 16.    On 11 April 2019 at about 4.30 pm, police officers from Bedok North Crime Strikeforce arrested the accused at the void deck of Blk 736 Tampines Street 72 Singapore 520736. A search was conducted on the accused. A packet containing crystalline substance (marked “AS-8”) was found in a black bag belonging to the accused and seized.

> 17.    The accused admitted ownership to the exhibit seized. The exhibit AS-8 was sealed in a tamper-proof bag and was submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) on 15 April 2019 for analysis.

> 18.    On 10 May 2019, Chin Shi Liy Reenie, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to AS-8, issued a certificate bearing Lab No.: ID-1932-00799-001. The certificate stated that AS-8 was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.07 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain methamphetamine.

> 19.    Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“MDA”).

> 20.    The accused identified AS-8 as containing “ice” or methamphetamine. He claimed to have purchased 0.1 g of methamphetamine from a male Chinese known to him as ‘Ah Seng’ for SGD $30, for his own consumption. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess a controlled drug. He had thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> 21.    The accused was charged in court on 13 April 2019. He was released on court bail in May 2019.

> Facts relating to DAC-921239-2020 (7 Aug 2019)

> 22.    On 7 Aug 2019, the accused contacted the company Five Dimensions Services (Trading) in order to rent a motorcycle from them for one week from 7 Aug 2019 to 13 Aug 2019. The rate was $105 per week. The owner of the company, Chan Joo Fah, requested to see the accused’s driving licence before the agreement was signed. The accused lied to Chan that he had not brought his licence with him. In truth, the accused did not possess a valid class 2B driving licence at the time as he had been disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence as mentioned in \[13\]. Chan then told the accused to send him photographs of his driving licence on WhatsApp.

> 23.    Thereafter, the accused took a photograph of his brother-in-law’s driving licence and edited the name, date of birth, date of issue, and NRIC number on the image of the licence to his own details using his mobile phone. He then sent these images to Chan to deceive him into believing that the accused held a valid class 2B driving licence. Believing that the accused had a valid class 2B driving licence, Chan delivered to the accused a motorcycle bearing FBH6704Y on 8 Aug 2019, which he would not have done had he not been so deceived. The accused has thereby committed an offence under s 420 PC.

> 24.    The accused rode the motorcycle home on 8 Aug 2019.

> Facts relating to DAC-921252-2020 and DAC-921253-2020 (10 Aug 2019)

> 25.    The complainant is Senior Staff Sergeant Mohammd Farhan Bin Sulhan. At the material time, he was posted to Jurong Division Bukit Batok NPC and was performing patrol duties at Blk 436A Bukit Batok West Ave 5, Singapore 651436,

> 26.    On 10 August 2019 at about 12.23 a.m., whilst the complainant was conducting checks at said location, he spotted the defendant standing next to motorcycle bearing FBH6704Y. The accused admitted to have ridden the motorcycle since 9 p.m. on 9 August 2019 for the purposes of making Grab Food deliveries. When the complainant ascertained the accused’s identity, he discovered that the accused had been disqualified from driving.

> 27.    As mentioned in \[13.\] above, the accused had been disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 5 years with effect from 13 Aug 2017 to 12 Aug 2022. By riding the motorcycle on 10 August 2019 whilst under disqualification, he has thereby committed an offence under s 43(4) RTA.

> 28.    As the accused was under disqualification at the material time, there was no insurance policy or such a security in force in relation to him as the user of the motorcycle FBH6704Y that complied with the requirements of the MVA. He has thereby committed an offence under s 3(1) punishable under s 3(2) of the MVA.

> Facts relating to DAC-909578-2020, DAC-924230-2020 and DAC-919474-2021 (2 Mar 2020)

> 29.    The complainant is Iswanda Bin Pujiyonoh. He called 999 on 2 March 2020 at 10.05 a.m. to report that his black Honda Super 4 motorcycle FS6730R had gone missing from the void deck of Blk 326C Sumang Walk Singapore 823326 (“the incident location”). He had last parked it at the incident location with the key in the ignition about two hours prior at about 8 a.m. The complainant was renting the motorcycle from KK Motors Pte Ltd at a rate of $35 per day. The complainant had left a bag valued at S$30 on the motorcycle. The bag in turn contained his wallet, cash of $50, his NRIC, his bank cards and driving licence; as well as a thermal delivery bag valued at $40.

> 30.    Investigations revealed that the accused was at the incident location at the material time when he saw the complainant’s motorcycle. The accused then decided to steal the motorcycle to use for his own transport and rode off with it. Investigations reveal that the value of the motorcycle was $2,500.

> 31.    In order to avoid being apprehended for his offence, the accused took the motorcycle to AT Enterprise located at Choa Chu Kang sometime on 2 or 3 March 2020 to have its number plates replaced with plates bearing the number FBA 4998A. The accused then removed the digit “8” from the licence plate and sprayed the licence plate with black paint to conceal the removal of the digit; he also moved the letter ‘A’ closer to the digit ‘9’ to conceal that the digit had been removed.

> 32.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed three offences as follows:

>> a)    The accused committed theft of the motorcycle and the various items on it which were in the complainant’s possession at the material time, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 379A PC;

>> b)    As mentioned in \[13\] above, the accused had been disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 5 years with effect from 13 Aug 2017 to 12 Aug 2022. He was also previously convicted of an offence under s 43(4) RTA on 23 November 2015, vide DAC-932135-2015, which conviction has not been set aside. Accordingly, by riding the motorcycle on 2 March 2020 while he was under disqualification, he has thereby committed an offence under s 43(4)(b) RTA;

>> c)    The accused did, from 3 to 10 March 2020, exhibit upon the complainant’s motorcycle a registration plate which had been altered, with intent to deceive, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 129(2)(d) RTA punishable under s 129(2) (iii) RTA.

> 33.    The accused had also thrown away the cashcard in the IU unit, removed stickers from the motorcycle, and removed the motorcycle box from the motorcycle in order to avoid getting caught by the police. The motorcycle was later recovered by the police on 10 March 2020 from where the accused had last parked it at an open carpark located at Blk 177 Boon Lay Drive. The accused admitted that he did not go back for the motorcycle because he saw the police recovering it.

> Intervening circumstances

> 34.    The accused’s bailor filed a police report on 24 March 2020 to state that he had lost contact with the accused since 18 March 2020. The accused failed to attend court on 2 April 2020 and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

> 35.    The accused deliberately did not attend court on this occasion because he did not want to be arrested for his recent cases of motorcycle theft. Thereafter, he avoided returning to his registered residence as he knew that police would look for him there and stayed with his relative instead.

> Facts relating to DAC-908997-2020, DAC-919479-2021 and DAC-919477-2021 (3 Apr 2020)

> 36.    The complainant is Fam Teck San. On 3 April 2020 at 7.09 a.m., he called the police to report that his black Yamaha Y125Z motorcycle FX3770T had gone missing from the open carpark at Blk 481 Jurong West St 41 Singapore 640481 (“the incident location”). He had last parked it at the incident location on 2 April 2020 at 7.00 p.m.

> 37.    Investigations reveal that the accused was at the incident location at about 2.00 a.m. on 3 April 2019. He was supposed to meet a friend there but the latter did not turn up. The accused did not want to walk home as he was afraid he would be spot-checked by the police and arrested. He tried to get his sister to book him a Grab in her name but she did not pick up his call. The accused then saw the complainant’s motorcycle in the area and decided to steal it to ride home. He hotwired the complainant’s motorcycle and rode it to Jurong West. He intentionally rode the motorcycle out of the carpark on the side pavement rather than the main road to avoid being captured by CCTV cameras.

> 38.    Thereafter, the accused decided to keep the complainant’s motorcycle to transport himself to his work at Tuas. In order to avoid being arrested for his offence, he removed the number plates from the complainant’s motorcycle and replaced it with a number plate with the number “FX9514C”. The accused had put this number plate together himself using tape.

> 39\. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed three offences as follows:

>> a)    The accused committed theft of the motorcycle which was in the complainant’s possession, and has thereby committed an offence under s 379A PC;

>> b)    As mentioned in \[13\] above, the accused had been disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 5 years with effect from 13 Aug 2017 to 12 Aug 2022. He was also previously convicted of an offence under s 43(4) RTA on 23 November 2015, vide DAC-932135-2015, which conviction has not been set aside. Accordingly, by riding the motorcycle on 3 April 2020 while he was under disqualification, he has thereby committed an offence under s 43(4)(b) RTA;

>> c)    The accused did, from 31 May 2020, exhibit upon the complainant’s motorcycle a registration plate which had been altered, with intent to deceive, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 129(2)(d) RTA punishable under s 129(2)(iii) RTA.

> 40.    The motorcycle was recovered on 31 May 2020.

> Facts relating to DAC-918963-2020 under s 8(b)(ii) p/u s 33A(1) MDA (31 May 2020)

> 41.    On 31 May 2020, police officers from Central Narcotics Bureau Jurong Police Division arrested the accused at Blk 150 Bedok Reservoir Road #XXX Singapore 470150. He was thereafter brought back to Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters for investigations.

> 42.    The accused provided two bottles of his urine specimen on 31 May 2020, which were both sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SL-20-00504-1 AHMAD BIN SAZALI Sxxxx782H” and “C-SL-20-00504-2 AHMAD BIN SAZALI Sxxxx782H” respectively in his presence. The urine samples were then sent to HSA for analysis on 1 June 2020.

> 43.    Two analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA issued the following certificates under s 16 of MDA.

>> a)    On 2 June 2020, Ng Xue Qin, having conducted the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SL-20-00504-1 AHMAD BIN SAZALI Sxxxx782H”, issued the certificate bearing Lab No. AT-2033-03125-001-03 stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

>> b)    On 15 June 2020, Kwok Yi Ling Miiko, having conducted the analysis in relation to urine sample marked as “C-SL-20-00504-2 AHMAD BIN SAZALI Sxxxx782H”, issued a certificate bearing Lab No. AT-2033-03125-002-03 stating that on analysis, the urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 44.    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. The accused is not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to consume methamphetamine.

> 45.    Further, before the commission of the said offence, the accused was:

>> c)    Admitted to an approved institution on 2 October 2013, namely, the Drug Rehabilitation Centre in Cluster B of the Changi Prison Complex, Singapore, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under s 34(2)(b) of the MDA, for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, methamphetamine; and,

>> d)    Convicted in District Court 9 on 23 November 2015, vide DAC-935479-2015, for an offence of consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, to wit, methamphetamine, and was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment.

> 46.    Neither his admission nor his conviction and sentence has not been set aside to date. The accused shall now be punished under s 33A(1) MDA.

## Antecedents

8       Apart from the relevant drug antecedents which related to the LT-1 drug consumption offence, the accused had the following antecedents for property and driving offences:-

> (a)     on 10 April 2012, he was convicted on one charge of theft in a dwelling house, punishable under s 380 of the PC. He was sentenced to one day’s imprisonment and a fine of $800;

> (b)     on 23 December 2013, he was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for driving under disqualification and to a fine of $800 for driving without insurance coverage. He was also disqualified for 24 months; and

> (c)     on 23 November 2015, he was sentenced to consecutive terms of 18 months’ imprisonment for two s 379A offences. For the sole count of driving under disqualification, he was sentenced to a consecutive term of four months’ imprisonment and disqualified for five years. He was also sentenced to a concurrent term of one month’s imprisonment for driving without insurance coverage. Two s 379A offences, two charges of driving under disqualification and one count of driving without insurance coverage were TIC.

## Consideration of sentence

9       The prosecution submitted that CT of seven to nine years should be imposed. The CT report found the accused suitable for the regime. He was assessed to be of moderate risk of re-offending with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release. He was also assessed to have a “pattern of offending behaviours and attitudes supportive of crime”. There were no significant protective factors against his re-offending.

10     Defence counsel submitted that a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) report should be called for. This was unrealistic as an MTO was not an available sentencing option. As submitted by the prosecution:-[^1]

> … an MTO is impermissible under Section 337(1)(i) of the CPC. On this occasion, the accused has been convicted of multiple offences punishable by imprisonment of more than 3 years. And Section 337(2)(c) of the CPC also does not apply because none of the requisite offences are prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code. So, there is simply no reason to call for a MTO report given that an MTO is not an available sentencing option on facts of this case.

11     In the alternative, counsel submitted for a global sentence of five to seven years’ imprisonment. No significant mitigating factors were raised.

#### Sentencing Framework

12     Section 304(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) provides:-

> 304.—(1)    Where a person of the age of 18 years or above —

>> (a)    is convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he reached the age of 16 years for offences punishable with such a sentence; or

>> (b)    is convicted at one trial before the High Court or a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted and sentenced in Singapore or elsewhere to imprisonment for at least one month since he reached the age of 16 years for an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more,

> then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should receive training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiration of his sentence, the court, unless it has special reasons for not doing so, shall sentence him to corrective training for a period of 5 to 14 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment.

13     There are two stages in determining if CT should be imposed: _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 209</span> (_“Sim Yeow Kee”_) at \[86\]-\[87\]. In Stage 1, the court should consider whether the offender satisfies the technical requirements for CT to be imposed. There was no dispute that this was met in the present case.

14     Stage 2 involves an inquiry as to whether it would be expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime. In this respect the court had to consider whether the interests of specific deterrence and reformation warrant the imposition of CT. In _Sim Yeow Kee_, Sundaresh Menon, CJ stated at \[98\]:-

> 98    The technical requirements for the imposition of CT – specifically, the stipulation in s 304(1) of the CPC that the offender must have a previous conviction or convictions (as the case may be) for “an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more” – reveal, in our judgment, that the operative justification for CT is specific deterrence and the reformation of the offender. The question before the court, therefore, is whether these interests of specific deterrence and reformation warrant the imposition of CT. In our judgment, while proportionality remains a relevant consideration in this analysis, it should be applied in an attenuated manner such that the court may _decline_ to impose CT if to do so would be _unduly disproportionate_, having regard to all the relevant circumstances…

15     The court then set out a three-step framework to ensure proportionality of sentence (“the framework”).

16     In Step 1 of the framework, the court must consider, “What is the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the offender for the underlying offence?” The prosecution submitted that the likely global sentence would be ten years’ imprisonment.[^2] This was not an unreasonable position. I assessed the likely global sentence to be around 9 to ten years’ imprisonment. Sentence would likely be as follows:-

> (a)     for the LT-1 drug consumption charge, at least the minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment;

> (b)     for each of his four s 379A charges, at least 20 months’ imprisonment. This would be an uplift of two months from his previous sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. Given the number of charges, sentences in at least two of these charges would run consecutively with each other and the other charges;

> (c)     for each of the four offences of driving under disqualification, sentence would be at least six months’ imprisonment. This would be an uplift of two months from his previous sentence of four months’ imprisonment. At least two of these sentences would run consecutively with each other and the other charges; and

> (d)     taking into account totality, the custodial sentences for the other charges would run concurrently and have no impact on overall sentence.

17     Thus, the global sentence had a regular term of imprisonment been imposed would have been at least nine years and four months.

18     In Step 2 of the framework, the question to ask is: “Would the MAS apply to the offender if he were sentenced to regular imprisonment?” The prosecution stated that the accused would be eligible for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”).[^3] However, the court in _Sim Yeow Kee_ stated at \[107\]:-

> 107    The analysis of proportionality (and the rehabilitative benefits of the MAS being made available to the offender) may bear little weight when a longer term of CT is called for, since the alternative would be a correspondingly longer term of imprisonment. Moreover, the emphasis in such cases would likely be on crime prevention and deterrence to a greater degree as a means of securing the reformation of the offender.

19     As the accused had in the past and in the present case committed at least nine s 379A offences, there had to be an emphasis on crime prevention and deterrence as a means of securing his reformation. While the MAS would have been available, little weight could be placed on this.

20     Step 3 of the framework involves a consideration of “Would a sentence of CT be unduly disproportionate?” The prosecution pointed out that the accused was a recalcitrant offender who had in the present case committed 31 offences within a period of 15 months. Of these, 10 distinct offences were committed while he was released on bail.[^4] The prosecution’s sentencing position of seven to nine years’ CT was not unduly disproportional as the accused would be sentenced to nine to 10 years’ imprisonment had a term of imprisonment been imposed. Defence counsel submitted that a custodial sentence of five to seven years’ imprisonment would be appropriate. The CT of seven years which was imposed fell within this range.

21     Due to the accused’s persistent offending behaviour, especially in relation to s 379A offences, there was a need for specific deterrence. The imposition of CT would specifically deter him from committing similar offences. It would also effectively send a message to him that there was a pressing need for him to reform. As the prosecution submitted:-[^5]

> The fact that the accused would not be entitled to release on license as of right if he were sentenced to CT further enhances the prospect of specifically deterring him, as it ensures that he will only be granted remission if he has made progress toward his rehabilitation.

22     Having regard to all the circumstances, the imposition of seven years’ CT, which would serve the twin goals of reformation and specific deterrence, was not unduly disproportionate. I backdated sentence to 11 April 2019, which was the date of his first arrest, with the time spent in remand and on bail to be taken into account in calculating sentence. The parties had no objections to this.

23     The mandatory three strokes of the cane were imposed for his LT-1 drug consumption charge. For his last conviction for driving under disqualification, the disqualification period imposed was five years. I was of the view that in general, disqualification for his driving offences should be escalated to 10 years in the present case. However, for the offences committed while he was on bail, an uplift of two years was imposed, so that the effective disqualification period would be 12 years for all classes of vehicles from the date of his release from prison.
