### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused.

2       The Accused had pleaded guilty to three charges before me and was sentenced as follows:

3       I ordered the sentences of imprisonment imposed for drink driving and the criminal force to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of 7 weeks and 5 days’ imprisonment.

4       Being dissatisfied with the sentence, the Accused has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. The Accused has been released on bail pending the appeal.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

6       The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.

### Background Information

7       I set out the facts as contained in the Statement of Facts.

8       At the material time, the Accused was working as a private hire driver and was the driver of the vehicle bearing registration no.: SMX6860P (“the vehicle”).

### Facts relating to the 1st Charge ( MAC-908763-2021 )

9       The complainant cum victim is one Narendren Balakrishnan (“the Complainant”), Male, a 33-year old Certis Cisco officer cum public servant. As part of the job, he performed parking enforcement spot checks and duties for the Land Transport Authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Housing Development Board.

10     On 29 April 2021 at about 11.20pm, the Complainant, whilst on duty, at the back alley behind 450 North Bridge Road, Bugis Cube, Singapore, spotted the vehicle parked along the double yellow lines marked on the road.

11     He proceeded to issue a summon in the form of a parking ticket. While he was doing so, the Accused appeared. The Accused had been drinking and was intoxicated.

12     He approached the Complainant and loudly questioned the Complainant as to why he was being issued a parking ticket. The Complainant replied that the Accused was not allowed to park at the said location. The Accused became unhappy and hurled vulgarities at the officer. After the Complainant had issued the parking ticket, the Accused started to behave aggressively.

13     When he realised that the Complainant was recording the incident, without grave or sudden provocation, and with the intent to deter the officer from discharging his duty as such public servant, he made physical contact with the Complainant when he used his hands to try to snatch the mobile device held by the Complainant.

14     The Complainant then called for the police. The Accused was eventually placed under arrest by the Police.

15     The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 353 of the Penal Code.

### Facts relating to the 6th Charge (DAC-901542-2022) and 7th Charge (DAC-901543-2022 )

16     The victim is one 29 year-old female, Chai Gek Chin. She was the passenger in the vehicle during the time of incident. The complainant is one Staff Sergeant Muhammad Harith Bin Jamat from the Traffic Police.

17     On 2 December 2021 at about 11.15 p.m., the police received a call with the following text message: “THERE IS AN ACCIDENT THERE IS A LADY LYING DOWN THERE.”

18     On 2 December 2021 at about 11.15 p.m., the Accused was driving his vehicle along Nicoll Highway towards Esplanade Drive, Singapore when he was involved in a major road traffic accident. The Accused had driven his vehicle without due care and attention. By failing to keep a proper control of the vehicle, his vehicle skidded to the left and grazed against the concrete barricade.

19     The complainant attended to the incident. While interviewing the Accused, the complainant noticed that the Accused reeked of alcohol. A breathalyzer test was conducted and the result showed “Fail”. The Accused was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and was escorted to Traffic Police for Breath Analyzing Device (BAD) test to be administered.

20     The BAD test was conducted by Staff Sergeant Nursiah on 3 December 2021 at about 1.11a.m. at the Traffic Police office located at 10 Ubi Avenue 3 Singapore 408865. The breath test revealed that the proportion of alcohol in accused’s breath was 78 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of breath. The prescribed limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

21     Investigation revealed that on 2 December 2021, at about 5.40 p.m., the Accused fetched the victim and drove the vehicle to Prinsep Street. They reached Prinsep Street around 6 p.m. and went to a pub. At the pub, the Accused drank four to five glasses of ‘Martel’. The Accused started drinking between 6pm to 7pm and finished drinking at about 10.30 p.m. The Accused then left with the victim by driving the vehicle. He intended to go to Geylang when he was involved with the above accident.

22     The Accused was not injured. The victim was conveyed conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. She sustained right leg pain. She was treated as an outpatient discharged with one week of medical leave.

23     Due to the accident, the Accused’s vehicle sustained damages, namely:

> (i)     Cracks and dents to the left front portion of vehicle;

> (ii)     Dents and scratches on the left front and rear tyres.

24     During the time of incident, the weather was clear, road surface was dry, visibility was clear, and the traffic flow was light.

25     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused, had committed the offences of:

> (i)     Drink driving under section 67(1)(b) and punishable under section 67(1) read with section 67(2)(a) of the RTA; and

> (ii)     Driving without due care and attention under section 65(1)(a) punishable under section 65(4)(c) read with Section 65(4)(a) and Section 65(6)(g) of the RTA.

26     Accordingly, under the RTA, the Accused is deemed a “serious offender”.

## ANTECEDENTS

27     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

28     The Prosecution is submitting for a global sentence of at least 8 weeks’ and 5 to 7 days’ imprisonment and disqualification of all classes of driving licence of 4 years, with the following breakdown:

> (i)     Using of criminal force against a public servant under section 353 of the Penal Code: 5 to 7 days’ imprisonment;

> (ii)     Drink driving under Section 67(1)(b): at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment and 4 years’ DQAC; and

> (iii)     Driving without due care and attention under section 65(1)(a) of the RTA: at least 2 weeks imprisonment and 2 years’ DQAC.

29     In relation to the offence of criminal force, the Prosecution submitted that while the harm and culpability level was low, fines should only be imposed in exceptional circumstances and the present case is not such a case. The case of PP v _Aw Soy Tee_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 213</span> (“_Aw Soy Tee_”) was cited in support of their submission for a short custodial sentence.

30     In respect of the RTA offences, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s BEA level would fall into Band 3 of _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v PP_ \[2022\] 3 SLR 933 (“_Rafael Voltaire Alzate_”) (as referred to in _Wu Zhi Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 261</span> (“_Wu Zhi Yong_”) at \[50\]), and hurt / property damage was caused. Thus for the section 67 RTA offence, a term of imprisonment would be the appropriate starting point given that the Accused caused injury to another, as “injury caused by a “drunk driver” represented the very evil that the ban on drunk driving was intended to prevent” (see _Wu Zhi Yong v PP_ at \[53\]).

31     The Prosecution submitted that applying _Wu Zhi Yong_, the High Court, albeit in the context of s 64(2C)(a) of the RTA read with s 64(2C)(c), the Accused’s blood alcohol level and given the legislative emphasis on the factor of drink driving, where an offender’s blood alcohol level is in the highest or second highest band of the framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_, the case is likely to fall at least within Band 2 of between one month’s and one year’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of three to four years.

32     The Prosecution has thus calibrated the individual sentence for the section 65 RTA offence downwards in arriving at their proposed sentence of at least 2 weeks’ imprisonments and 2 years’ DQAC.

## MITIGATION

33     In his written mitigation, the Accused expressed his remorse and apologised for behaving aggressively towards the Certis Cisco officer and for choosing to drive after consuming alcohol. He also realised that as a result of the accident, he had injured the victim who is his girlfriend.

34     On the personal front, he informed that he was a divorcee with a 10-year old son. He was working as a private hire driver and his earnings have been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

35     He was aware of the sentencing position of the Prosecution. He submitted for a 5-day imprisonment sentence for the criminal force charge. As for the driving offences, he asked for imprisonment terms of 4 weeks for the drink driving offence and 1 week for the driving without due care and attention offence and for both these sentences to run concurrently.

## THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE

### The sentencing principles

36     The sentencing principle for both the criminal force offence as well as drink driving related offences would clearly be that of deterrence.

#### Criminal force against a public servant under section 353 of the Penal Code

37     In the case of criminal force against public servant, the Court takes a very stern view of defiant behaviour against public servants in the discharge of their duties and where criminal force has been used against such public servants, the starting point would be a jail sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances.

38     This is outlined clearly in _Aw Soy Tee_, where a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment was affirmed by the High Court. The offender had pushed a female Auxiliary police officer from Certis Cisco who was performing enforcement duty for the National Environmental Agency, on her shoulder and chest area. The officer was trying to obtain the offender’s particulars after spotting him spitting in public. The learned District Judge in the decision also highlighted that the High Court had, in hearing an appeal in the case of _PP v Chua Cheng Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 158</span>, affirmed that the starting tariff for an offence of using criminal force on a public servant is a short custodial term.

39     Whilst the use of criminal force in snatching a handphone is clearly less serious in terms of harm when compared to pushing an officer on the chest, I note that there was an aggravating feature in the present case.

40     The Accused was in an intoxicated state. In that state of intoxication, he became more aggressive when he became unhappy with the Complainant. He not only spoke in a loud voice but subsequently shouted vulgarities at the Complainant when he was issued a parking ticket. Self-induced intoxication is an aggravating factor as an offender in an intoxicated state with accompanying aggressive behaviour can cause more alarm to a victim. It was thus not surprising that at this stage that the Complainant had used his handphone to record the action of the Accused. The principle that a sentencing judge should ordinarily take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration and the reasons for treating it as such has been enunciated clearly by the High Court in _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ \[2009\] 1SLR (R) 115 \[45-49\].

41     Accordingly, I found that the custodial threshold for the present case has been crossed but in view of the much less physical contact than a push on the chest, I have calibrated the length of imprisonment down to 5 days.

#### Drink driving under section 67 of the RTA

42     An offence of drink driving under section 67(1)(b) of the RTA is punishable with a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both. In addition, section 67(2)(a) of the RTA also provides for a minimum disqualification of 2 years.

43     The High Court in _Wu Zhi Yong_ had held at \[53\] that

> “a term of imprisonment will generally be an appropriate starting point where an offender has caused personal injury or damage to property as a result of driving whilst under the influence of drink. As injury caused by a drunk driver “represents the very evil that the ban on drunk driving was intended to prevent”: _Stansilas__[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)_ at \[42\], sentences in the higher region of the sentencing range are naturally engaged.”

44     In _Stansilas_, the High Court had held at \[74\] that in considering the circumstances and gravity of the offence under section 67 of the RTA, regard should be had to the degree of harm caused and culpability of the offender, which would entail consideration of the extent to which the offender’s alcohol level exceeds the prescribed limit as well as the manner of the offender’s driving.

45     The description of harm and culpability in terms of factors were set out by the High Court at \[75\] as follows:

> (a)     Harm

>> (i)    slight – slight or moderate property damage and/or slight physical injury characterised by no hospitalisation or medical leave;

>> (ii)   moderate – serious property damage and/or moderate personal injury characterised by hospitalisation or medical leave but no fractures or permanent injuries;

>> (iii)   serious – serious personal injury usually involving fractures, including injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures; and

>> (iv)   very serious – loss of limb, sight or hearing or life; or paralysis.

> (b)     Culpability

>> (i)    low – low alcohol level and no evidence of dangerous driving behaviour;

>> (ii)   medium – moderate to high alcohol level or dangerous driving behaviour; and

>> (iii)   high – high alcohol level and dangerous driving behaviour.

46     The High Court then went on at \[78\] to set out the following indicative sentencing ranges that had been calibrated according to the degree of harm caused and the offender’s culpability, once a court is satisfied that the custodial threshold has been crossed:

> (a)    a term of imprisonment of between four and six months in cases of very serious harm and high culpability;

> (b)    a term of imprisonment of between two and four months in cases of serious harm and high culpability or of very serious harm and medium culpability;

> (c)    a term of imprisonment of up to two months in cases of moderate harm and high culpability, of serious harm and medium culpability, of very serious harm and low culpability or of slight harm and high culpability; and

> (d)    a term of imprisonment of up to a month in cases involving any other combinations of the degrees of harm and culpability identified at \[75\] above.

47     Bearing in mind that the above sentencing guideline ranges were promulgated based on the entirety of the sentencing permissible under the then section 67 of the RTA which provided for a maximum punishment of six months, as the maximum sentence has now been enhanced to double the original length to 12 months, the applicable sentencing ranges ought similarly be double what was set out above. Hence, I have accordingly adjusted the sentencing ranges to (a) 8-12 months, (b) 4-8 months, (c) 2-4 month and (d) up to 2 months of imprisonment respectively.

48     The High Court had also set out in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ a sentencing framework for drink driving applicable where no harm to person or property had been caused, based only on the level of alcohol in the offender’s body:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.32%"><col width="32.4%"><col width="35.28%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of alcohol (µg per 100ml of breath)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of fines</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of Disqualification</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-54</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000-$4,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24-30 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">55-69</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$4,000-$6,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30-36 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70-89</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000-$8,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-48 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">≥90</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$8,000-$10,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">48-60 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

49     Turning to the present facts, I found that the Accused’s culpability and harm caused would clearly bring it past the custodial threshold, given the high blood alcohol level as well as the fact that harm was caused.

50     The indicative level based on the BEA reading of the Accused at 78 μg per 100ml of breath is well within the second highest band of Band 3 based on the level as set out in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_, which is 70-89 μg .

51     To arrive at the starting indicative range, in terms of culpability, I found that the Accused’s culpability can be considered to be at the high end of medium culpability. I considered his blood alcohol level at the second highest band as well as the fact that the Accused had been very irresponsible to drive after drinking continuously for more than three and a half hours. He was reeking of alcohol when he was found at the accident scene.

52     As for the manner of his driving, it clearly showed that that he was not in a state to exercise proper control of his vehicle. The condition of the road surface on that evening was dry and yet he skidded to the side whilst driving along Nicoll Highway and grazed against the concrete barricade. It was fortuitous that not more damage or hurt was caused.

53     In terms of harm caused, besides the property damage to his vehicle, hurt was caused to his passenger. She had been sent to the hospital by ambulance and treated as an outpatient for leg pain. She was subsequently discharged with medical leave of one week. The level of harm in this case would fall into the moderate category following the characterisation of such personal injury in _Stansilas_ set out at \[45\] above as “hospitalisation or medical leave but with no fractures or permanent injuries”.

54     Therefore applying the sentencing frameworks as set out above at \[47\] above, I found that based on medium culpability and medium harm, the starting indicative sentence would fall somewhere in between 2 months and 4 months’ imprisonment. I have pegged it at 10 weeks’ imprisonment at this initial stage.

55     Looking at the mitigating factors, I found that the Accused had shown remorse by pleading guilty at an early stage. I had thus calibrated the sentence downwards to 7 weeks’ imprisonment.

56     As for the period of disqualification, I had imposed 3 years which is the lowest period in the range of 36-48 months as set out in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_ based on his blood alcohol level.

#### Driving without due care and attention under section 65(1)(a) read with sections 65(4)(c) and 65(4)(a) of the RTA

57     The offence of driving without due care and attention under section 65(1)(a) of the RTA read with sections 65(4)(c) and 65(4)(a) is punishable with an additional punishment of a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or with imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, in addition to any punishment under section 65(5)(a) which provides for a fine of up to $1,500 and imprisonment up to 6 months or both. In addition, such an offender will also be disqualified for a minimum period of 2 years. The compounded effect of the two sub-sections would be a minimum fine of $2,000 up to a maximum of $11,500 or a maximum imprisonment of 18 months or both.

58     There is no sentencing framework promulgated by the High Court for an offence punishable under section 65(4)(c) read with section 65(4)(a) of the RTA where hurt is caused by a “serious offender”. However one has been set out for section 64 of the RTA for dangerous driving in _Wu Zhi Yong_. I found that the guidelines in terms of offence-specific and offender-specific factors set out in _Wu Zhi Yong_ would provide a useful guide given that section 64 prescribes for similar tiered punishment provisions under section 64(2C)(c) read with section 64(2C)(a), for an offence where in any case other than death, grievous hurt or hurt is caused by a “serious offender”. A “serious offender” has been defined under section 64(8) of the RTA to mean an offender who is convicted of an offence under section 67 or 70(4) of the RTA in relation to his driving which formed the subject matter of an offence under sections 64 and 65 of the Act.

59     The compounded effect for an offence punishable under section 64(2C)(c) read with section 64(2C)(a) has been concluded in _Wu Zhi Yong_ to be a fine of between $2,000 and $15,000 and/or an imprisonment term not exceeding 24 months, as well as a disqualification period of no less than two years.

60     The sentencing range for imprisonment under section 65(4)(c) read with section 65(4)(a) is therefore lower by 6 months. Accordingly I find that the sentencing bands enunciated in _Wu Zhi Yong_ as well as the sentencing approach propounded therein would still provide a useful guide and can be applied to sentencing a section 65 offence with the necessary calibration downwards to take into consideration the less serious nature of an offence under section 65.

61     In _Wu Zhi Yong_ at \[39\], the High Court has set out the following bands for an offence under section 64(2C)(a) of the RTA read with s 64(2C)(c), as follows:

> (a)     Band 1: A fine of between $2,000 and $15,000 and/or up to one month’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of two to three years.

> (b)     Band 2: Between one month’s and one year’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of three to four years.

> (c)     Band 3: Between one year’s and two years’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of four to five years.

62     Bearing in mind the shorter sentencing range for an offence punishable under section 65(4)(c) read with section 65(4)(a) of the RTA as set out at \[57\] above, I have calibrated the sentencing bands downwards as follows:

> (a)     Band 1: A fine of between $2,000 and $11,500 and/or up to three weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of two years;

> (b)     Band 2: Between three weeks and 9 months’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of two to three years; and

> (c)     Band 3: Between 9 months and 18 months’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of three to four years.

63     A two-step sentencing approach was adopted in _Wu Zhi Yong_. It has been summarised at \[49\] as follows:

> At the first step, the court determines the appropriate sentencing band which the offence in question falls into, having regard to the offence-specific aggravating factors present in the case. The factor of drink driving, as reflected in the alcohol level in an offender’s blood or breath, would be given significant weight at this step in determining the appropriate sentencing band. Within the appropriate band and corresponding sentencing range, the court then arrives at an indicative starting point. At the second step, the court calibrates the sentence from that starting point by having regard to the offender-specific factors present.

64     The High Court in _Wu Zhi Yong_ had stated at \[42\] that

> Band 2 consists of cases reflecting a higher level of seriousness and would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors. In these cases, the level of culpability and the blood alcohol level will typically both be on the higher side. Given the legislative emphasis on the factor of drink driving, where an offender’s blood alcohol level is in the highest or second highest band of the framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_, the case is likely to fall at least within Band 2.

65     Applying the abovestated sentencing approach, I start first with the offence-specific factors. The indicative level based on the BEA reading of the Accused at 78 μg per 100ml of breath is well within the second highest band of Band 3 based on the level as set out in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate_, which is 70-89 μg .

66     I have also earlier considered the fact that the harm caused in terms of personal injury was of moderate level.

67     Accordingly, given that there were at least two offence-specific aggravating factors, the starting point for the present case would fall into band 2 of at least 3 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualification of 2-3 years.

68     I then move to the second step of considering the offender-specific factors. The Accused had shown remorse by his cooperation with the authorities and had pleaded guilty.

69     I had therefore calibrated the sentence down to 2 weeks’ imprisonment and impose the lowest possible period of disqualification of 2 years.

### Global Sentence

70     Given that the same set of facts underly both the offence of drink driving and the offence of driving without due care and attention, the sentences for both these offences should be ordered to run concurrently. This was also the approach taken by the High Court in _Wu Zhi Yong_ where it held at \[64\] that it would usually be appropriate in such a situation for the sentences under sections 64 and 67 to run concurrently when they are based on the same facts.

71     By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, I would have to order the remaining imprisonment term to run consecutively. I have accordingly ordered the sentences imposed for the driving related offences to run concurrently with each other and to run consecutively with the sentence imposed on the criminal force offence.

72     The final sentence is thus 7 weeks and 5 days’ imprisonment with a disqualification period of 3 years from the date of release from prison.
